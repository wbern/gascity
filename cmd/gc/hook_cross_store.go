// # Leg relevance, taken from the plan rather than from the store list
//
// The hook's legs are bd WORKSPACES, and it fans out across them because
// `bd ready` reads exactly one store. On a federated city that premise is gone:
// the primary leg runs `gc ready`, whose own legs are Plan(RoutedWork) — the
// city work store, the rigs ascending, the relocated binding last — so its
// answer is a SUPERSET of every extra leg's, tier by tier. An extra can
// therefore never contribute a candidate the primary did not already return; it
// can only re-open every store and pay the federated legs again.
//
// So the relevant leg set for a federated claim read is exactly one leg, and
// that is what this returns. On mc's topology it takes a hook tick from six
// full work-query runs (one federated, five single-store) to one, and the
// dropped five were each a strictly narrower view of the same city.
//
// # Why the extras are no longer coverage
//
// They used to be: the crash-recovery tier ran `bd list --status in_progress`
// and the wisp probes ran `bd query`, neither of which the city-wide reader
// answered, so collapsing the loop would have stripped rig coverage from crash
// recovery. Both are closed now. The crash-recovery tier swapped to `gc ready
// --status in_progress`, and every federated leg is read at
// beads.FederatedReadTier, which spans the wisp tier — so the ephemeral rows a
// per-store `bd query` used to find are in the federated answer.
// TestTheFederatedReaderAnswersEveryTierTheExtrasUsedTo is the guard: if either
// tier regresses to a single-store read, the extras have to come back.
//
// # The signal
//
// federatedCommand and singleStoreCommand are the two forms of the same agent's
// query. They are EQUAL for a custom (verbatim) work_query and on a city that
// relocates nothing, and the call is then a no-op returning stores unchanged.

// <rig> store FIRST: its routed work lives there, but its city-scoped

// subprocess call, and I15 pins the see-but-cannot-claim asymmetry until it does.

// bestStoreWithWork runs command against each store and returns the output and

// anything (applying the same normalize + unready-filter that doHook uses, so a
// store with only deferred/blocked rows is not a hit). run is injectable for
// tests.
//
// Why ranking rather than first-hit: the store list puts a city-scoped agent's
// OWN store ahead of the federated rig stores, so returning the first hit meant
// a rig-routed P0 stayed invisible behind a city P2 for as long as the city
// store had anything at all. Priority was never compared across the store
// boundary, so priority could not rescue it — for a crew agent that always has
// some city work, rig-routed beads were not deprioritized but unreachable.
// Ranking compares candidates the way the three-tier work_query intends them to
// be consumed (see hookCandidateRank), which makes the ordering hold ACROSS
// stores as well as within one. This changes only WHICH already-matching store
// is selected: every store's query still matches this agent's own identity, so
// no bead becomes visible that was not already routed or assigned to it.
//
// An exact tie rotates across every store tied for the best rank, using
// hookTieBreakClock rather than always keeping the first-seen store. Always
// preferring slice order (in practice, the agent's own store, since it is
// stores[0]) meant a tie that persisted across calls — the common case for a
// steady stream of same-tier, same-priority work — starved every other tied
// store forever: the comparison is deterministic and re-runs identically on
// every hook invocation (ga-kbbg9a). Rotating only changes WHICH tied store
// wins; a candidate that is not tied for the best rank is never affected.
//
// Two deliberate carve-outs from ranking:
//   - A tier-0 (in_progress) candidate in the PRIMARY store short-circuits.
//     Resuming this session's own interrupted work is unconditional, nothing may
//     preempt it, and short-circuiting keeps the hot resume path at one query.
//   - If any hit's output cannot be ranked (non-JSON, or JSON that is not an
//     array of objects), selection degrades to first-hit for the whole call.
//     Reordering on a comparison we could not actually make would be worse than
//     the behavior it replaces.
//
// Ranking is applied in two passes, grouped by store dir (see
// bestRankedCandidate): raw tier stays meaningful WITHIN a dir — more than one
// hookStore entry can share a dir when they are different query legs over the
// SAME backing store (e.g. the claim-time class-routing front door's assigned
// and routed legs), and there the assigned tier must still win deterministically
// or a relocated graph step flip-flops onto a consolation bead every other tick,
// recreating the re-serve/re-skip treadmill ga-601v2 closed. Only ACROSS
// distinct dirs does tier collapse so priority decides (crossStoreRank) — that
// cross-dir collapse is what ga-t922vm fixed. In real deployments every
// hookWorkQueryStores entry already has a distinct dir, so the two passes
// coincide with a flat cross-store comparison; the dir grouping only matters for
// same-dir multi-leg callers like the class-routing front door's test harness.
//
// When no store has ready work, an error on the agent's OWN store (identified by
// primary, not by slice position) is surfaced so emitCityWorkQueryFailure can
// classify it — preserving the single-store emit-on-timeout contract (a
// work-query timeout must reach the reconciler, not be silently downgraded to
// "no work"). Errors from federated rig stores are best-effort discovery (like
// appendRigHookStores) and are not surfaced, so one flaky rig store can't wedge
// the hook. primary is matched by identity rather than position because the
// federated claim loop reselects over a shrinking store set: once the primary
// store has been dropped it is no longer in stores, so no later federated store
// may inherit its emit-on-timeout semantics.

// claimStoreWithFallback re-validates the discovery-selected store for

// one store for the claim mutation. Re-running only the selected store would
// drain as "no work" whenever its claimable row was taken between discovery and
// claim — even though a later federated store still has ready routed work. The
// returned output is the work-query result the claim should act on, paired with
// the store it came from so the mutation runs against that store's bd context.
// (The narrow window between this re-validation and the bd update --claim is
// still handled by the claim itself skipping rows it cannot take.)

// A re-validation error on the selected store is surfaced only when that store
// is the primary (own) store; a federated store erroring at claim time is

// emit-on-timeout contract so a flaky rig store can't wedge the claim.

// # One leg means nothing to fall back TO, so there is nothing to re-validate
//
// The whole reason to re-read is the LATER store: draining as "no work" when a
// federated peer still has ready routed work is the strand this exists to
// prevent. A single-leg fan-out — every federated city after S3, where the
// primary's reader answers for the whole plan — has no later store, so the
// second read can only pay another full city-wide query for a row the claim
// itself re-checks anyway (`bd update --claim` skips rows it cannot take). On
// mc's topology that read is the more expensive half of the claim.
