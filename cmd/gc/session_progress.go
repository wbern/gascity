// been refreshed onto the snapshot. It feeds the min-floor idle-worker

// isWarmFloorCandidate reports whether a session Info currently occupies a warm

// only StateNone (freshly stamped, not yet transitioned), StateActive and
// StateAwake (running; Awake is the reconciler healState alias for Active —
// session_reconcile.go / lifecycle_projection.go RuntimeProjectionAlive),
// StateCreating, and StateStartPending count.
//
// It adopts countMinActiveCovered's allow-list SHAPE (compute_awake_set.go)
// rather than diverging into a deny-list — but deliberately not its state SET.
// countMinActiveCovered admits only active/creating (plus an asleep bead an
// earlier pass already marked desired-awake); this predicate additionally
// admits Awake, StartPending and StateNone, and never admits asleep. The two
// answer different questions: this one ranks the CURRENT warm occupancy of one
// session, so anything on its way to (or already) running counts and a dormant
// bead never does, while countMinActiveCovered counts coverage of the floor
// including the asleep sessions this tick's wake pass will revive.
//
// Why an allow-list (Doc adversarial re-review, sc-sabwwn): every other state —
// Asleep, Suspended, Draining, Drained, Archived, FailedCreate, Quarantined,
// Closed — is a dormant, terminal, or non-runnable bead that can persist with
// Closed==false yet is NOT a warm occupant. Counting any such stale low-id bead
// would inflate the floor rank in isMinFloorExemptIdleSession and mask the ACTUAL
// live low-id floor session out of the deterministic exempt set, getting that
// warm session idle-killed and cold-recreated — the exact 0<->1 oscillation this
// fix (sc-5mtyhy) exists to eliminate. A deny-list silently reopened that gap for
// every state it forgot (Quarantined/FailedCreate/Drained/Archived did leak); the
// allow-list fails closed — an unknown or newly-added state is excluded, never a
// spurious floor occupant. The info.Closed guard stays first: a closed bead has
// State=="" (StateNone), which the allow-list admits, so occupancy must be
// rejected on Closed before the state switch.

// isMinFloorExemptIdleSession reports whether sessionID is one of the

// tick (sc-5mtyhy). This is the per-session, deterministic complement to the
// count-based isMinFloorIdleWorker the progress-stall recycler uses.
//
// The exempt set is the POOL-MANAGED floor members only. Ranking mirrors
// isMinActivePoolBead (compute_awake_set.go), the predicate that defines which
// beads the min_active_sessions guarantee covers: configured-named, manual and
// dependency-only sessions are excluded because they carry their own keep-awake
// rules and never participate in the floor. Excluding them matters in both
// directions — a lower-id non-pool session must not consume a floor rank (which
// would push the real pool member out of the exempt set and no-op this fix in a
// mixed-identity template), and a non-pool session must never become
// idle-exempt itself. Like isMinActivePoolBead the filter is exclusion-based:
// it does NOT require a positive pool-managed flag, so legacy pool beads
// predating that projection still rank.
//
// Determinism (spec acceptance 4): the exempt set is the minSess lowest-id warm
// same-template pool sessions, mirroring cityStopPoolBeads' bead-ID ordering, so
// the same concrete sessions stay warm tick over tick with no flapping over
// which one is exempt. sessionID is exempt exactly when it is itself a warm
// same-template pool session AND fewer than minSess such sessions sort below its
// ID. Elastic sessions ABOVE the floor are never exempt and idle-reclaim
// normally (acceptance 2); max_active_sessions still caps the total because this
// only defers idle kills for the bottom minSess sessions — it never creates any.

//     recovers (composes with the provider-health respawn gate, move 3a).

// isMinFloorProtectedDrainAckSession reports whether honoring a drain-ack for
// sessionID would strand the template's min_active_sessions floor empty — the

//
// THE CONTRADICTION IT RESOLVES: min_active_sessions says "a session of this
// template must always exist"; the drain-ack protocol says "I found no work,
// stop me". A pool worker at a floor whose ready queue is empty holds both at
// once, so the reconciler honored the ack, closed the session, dropped the
// pool below its floor, and min_fill immediately booted a replacement that
// repeated the cycle — 8 sessions in 29 minutes, period 75-170s, indefinitely.
// Deleting the floor is not the cure: the floor is what cured the orphan-flap
// (dip-ep6me2). The cure is to make the drain-ack site floor-aware the same way
// the idle-timeout and progress-stall sites already are.
//
// WHY THE DETERMINISTIC TWIN, NOT THE COUNT-BASED isMinFloorIdleWorker: this
// predicate delegates to isMinFloorExemptIdleSession, the SAME per-session
// membership the idle-timeout path uses, so a session kept alive here is
// exactly a session that path also keeps warm. Wiring the count-based predicate
// in instead would keep a session alive at this site only to have the idle path
// kill it a tick later in a pool above its floor — reinstating the loop with one
// extra hop — and it exempts EVERY session in an at-floor pool rather than the
// named floor members, so elastic sessions above the floor could not retire.
//
// It answers membership only. The caller is responsible for the equally
// load-bearing half: applying it ONLY to a self-initiated ack (no outstanding
// drain request, not reconciler-owned), so an operator drain, a config-drift
// drain or a reconciler-minted orphan ack still stops the session as ordered.
