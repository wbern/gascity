//
// `list`, `ready` and `search` are here for the same reason and they were the

// not look like an id position. `gc bd list --metadata-field
// gc.root_bead_id=<gcg root>` answered `[]` with exit 0 on a converged split
// city: --metadata-field is not id-VALUED, so the by-id door in cmd_bd_by_id.go
// correctly declined it (a quoted id decides nothing about ownership), and bd
// then ran the projection successfully against the one ledger that holds no
// gcg- row. The value named an id but the VERB is a PROJECTION over a class
// this ledger cannot see, and a projection that cannot see a class must fail
// loudly rather than answer with the empty set. That is the whole of ga-iaj7k's
// Invariant 0, and it is what makes `list` COHERENT with `dep tree` — which
// answers a relocated id from the store that holds it, rather than emptily from
// the one that does not. Two projections over the same data with opposite
// failure semantics is worse than either one alone, because an operator who
// learned the loud one trusts the quiet one.
//
// `search` is the same projection over the same flag: bd registers
// --metadata-field for it too, and it answers no-match with `[]` and exit 0.
// Guarding `list` alone would have minted the asymmetry it retired — one verb
// over, on the same molecule, through the same selector. It shares `list`'s
// scan because it shares bd's selector dialect, so the negatives that keep a
// free-text search answerable hold for both unchanged.
//
// `ready` takes --metadata-field as well but is NOT here: it is refused by
// topology instead, in bdRelocatedClassBlindVerbs, which strictly subsumes what
// this scan would have caught for it. See there for why. `list` stays here
// because its selectors span this ledger's own rows — except when it carries
// --ready, which is not a selector at all but a switch onto the same frontier
// query, and is refused by the same topology arm.
//
// The other verbs are unguarded because they are no longer blind, not because
// they were ever safe:
//
//   - `show`, `update` (including `--claim`), `release-if-current`, `dep list`
//     and `dep tree` are answered IN PROCESS from the binding their class is
//     served from — cmd_bd_by_id.go, wired into doBd immediately after this
//     scan — so they never reach the subprocess for a class-owned bead.
//   - Spellings of those verbs the in-process arm does not implement — `dep tree
//     --show-all-paths`, `--status`, `--format`, `--direction=both` — are
//     REFUSED there (exit 1, naming the bead and the binding) rather than
//     forwarded, because serving them by dropping the flag would answer a
//     different question than the one asked.
//   - Every other bd subcommand that ADDRESSES a reserved-prefix id — in a
//     positional or an id-valued flag — is refused there too, by ownership
//     rather than by servability.
//
// The selector surface is COMPLETE, and that is checkable rather than hopeful:
// --metadata-field — the only bd flag whose value side is a key=value predicate
// on a read — is registered on exactly three subcommands (list.go, ready.go,
// search.go in the pinned beads module), and every one of them is refused by
// this map or by bdRelocatedClassBlindVerbs.
// TestBdRelocatedClassGuardCoversEverySelectorVerb pins that against bdflags so
// a fourth cannot appear unguarded.

// # Why `ready` is here and bare `list` is not
//
// The selector guard above classifies TEXT: it fires when an argument names a
// relocated id namespace in an id-shaped position, because that is the case
// where the empty answer is provably wrong for the predicate that was asked.
// That is the right trigger for `list` and `search`, whose selectors span the
// whole ledger — `bd list --status open` is a question about the rows THIS
// ledger holds and bd answers it correctly.
//
// `ready` is not that shape. It computes a FRONTIER — "the claimable work in
// this store" — and takes no selector that could reach another store, so on a
// city that serves a coordination class from a binding its result is the
// work-class subset of the city's ready set, short by exactly the beads the
// split moved, for every invocation. Measured on a converged split city, `gc
// ready` returned 9 beads including 3 graph-resident ones and matched the API
// id-for-id, while `gc bd ready` returned 5 with none of them, exit 0 — and it
// still returned exit 0 with the relocated binding chmod-000, which is the
// state a loud failure exists for (ga-jbn6f). Scanning argv would have guarded
// the rare `gc bd ready --metadata-field gc.root_bead_id=<gcg root>` and left
// the bare `gc bd ready` — the invocation an operator types, and the one the
// original report measured — answering short and quiet. So the trigger is the
// class assignment in [storage.classes]: a fact about the city, checked before
// any argument is read.
//
// The topology trigger strictly subsumes the selector one for this verb, which
// is why `ready` was removed from bdRelocatedClassGuardedVerbs rather than
// added here alongside it — two triggers for one verb, where one always fires
// first, is a dead branch that reads as coverage.
//
// A city that relocates nothing has no entry to match against, so a
// single-store `gc bd ready` is byte-identical: same argv, same bd binary, same
// exit code. bdSQLRelocatedClassRefusal returns early on an empty relocated
// set, before this map is consulted at all.
//
// Not guarded here: a `ready` hidden behind an unrecognized root flag, which
// bdRelocatedClassVerb cannot locate. That case already fails closed for TEXT
// (every dialect scan runs over the remaining arguments), and bd itself rejects
// the unknown flag before running anything, so the invocation cannot produce a

// bd will read it from: doBd runs the subprocess with cmd.Dir = target.ScopeRoot.
// Reading it in the wrapper's own cwd instead resolved the same token against two
// different roots, and the damaging direction is silent — the plan exists under
// the scope root but not under cwd, this read fails, parsed=false forwards the
// create, and bd finds the plan and mints the relocated-class bead. Two roots for
// one path is also how a plan could be classified against a DIFFERENT file that

//
// bd's own `-C/--directory` does not disturb this. Despite its help text
// ("Change to this directory before running the command (like git -C)"), `-C`
// selects the beads PROJECT bd opens — it is validated as such, with
// `cannot use -C directory "...": no beads project found` — and is not the base
// for a relative path argument. bd resolves `--graph <path>` against its process
// cwd, and doBd pins that cwd with a single unconditional
// `cmd.Dir = target.ScopeRoot` (cmd_bd.go), the same root threaded here, so this
// read and bd's read name the same file with or without `-C`. Probed against bd
// 1.1.0 in both directions: with the plan present in cwd only, bd parses it even
// under `-C <other project>`; with the plan present under the `-C` directory
// only, bd reports it missing.
//
// parsed=false is not a swallowed error: bd applies the identical json.Unmarshal

// mint: `import`, `batch` and `create-form` remain unguarded, as documented on
// bdRelocatedClassCreateShape. Where it does fire it fails differently from the
// read guard: a blind READ answers emptily and can be re-run once the operator
// knows better, while a blind CREATE leaves a row in the wrong ledger under the
// wrong prefix — a bead no later read finds, and no migration moves, because
// renaming it into the class namespace afterwards is not something any backend
// can do.
//
// It refuses rather than reroutes because rerouting is impossible on this seam:
// only argv crosses to the bd subprocess, and the binding is opened in process.
// The gc-native commands in bdRelocatedClassMintPaths are the supported doors,
// and the refusal names the one that fits.
//
// The classifier is coordclass.Classify — the production one the router and the
// migration use — and not a lookalike label list. The split is not type-shaped:
// an extmsg record is a type=task bead carrying a gc:extmsg-* label and a nudge
// is a type=chore bead, so any table written here would have to relearn the
// boundary and would drift from it.
//
// scopeRoot is the directory doBd will run bd in (target.ScopeRoot), and it is
// threaded here for the file-backed arms: a relative `--graph` path names a file
// relative to THAT root, not to the wrapper's cwd. An empty scopeRoot means no
// root is known and relative paths resolve as the process sees them.
//
// An undecidable verb — a subcommand hidden behind a root flag that is in
// NEITHER global manifest — returns no refusal, unlike the read scan's
// fail-closed judgment of every remaining token. The premise is that a flag this
// package does not know is one bd does not know either, so bd rejects it and
// exits before creating anything. That premise holds only while the manifests in
// internal/bdflags track bd's real persistent flags, and it did not hold once:
// --profile was filed as a bool and --database, --server-url and --mem-profile
// were in neither map, so four flags bd accepts and mints behind reached this arm
// and switched the guard off. (Two of those four, --profile and --server-url, no
// longer exist upstream as of v1.3.0-rc.2, so for them the premise now genuinely
// holds; --database and --mem-profile are carried in the value manifest.)
// The manifests are pinned exactly — value and bool
// sets compared separately by TestGlobalValueFlagsIsComplete and
// TestGlobalBoolFlagsIsComplete — so restoring that premise is a build failure
// away rather than a silent fail-open, and
// TestBdCreateRefusesAnInfraShapedCreateBehindABdRootFlag pins the composition
// from this end. Failing closed here instead is not the cheaper answer: with no
// verb there is no dialect either, so judging the remaining tokens under the
// create dialect would refuse `gc bd <unknown-flag> list --type message`, a READ.
