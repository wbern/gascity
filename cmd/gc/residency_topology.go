// The cmd/gc topology constructors: opened routes as data.
//
// storeref's residency resolver is pure — it plans over a Topology and opens
// nothing. This file builds that Topology for the two cmd/gc planes: the
// one-shot CLI (which resolves its own storage funnel) and the controller
// (which opened its binding at boot).
//
// # From OPENED ROUTES, never from config
//
// This is the cityQueryTopology lesson, and it is why neither constructor reads
// [storage]. storageSplitShapeOf reads the section alone and answers "no split"
// for a city whose section was DELETED after it had already served one. That
// city's infrastructure beads are in a binding, its boot refuses, and its
// routes serve every infrastructure class from refusedClassStore. Asking config
// would build it a work-only topology whose plans read the work ledger and
// report "no work" forever; asking the ROUTES gets the refusal, which fails
// loud with the sentence that names the remedy.
//
// # Told, not deciding
//
// A constructor takes the opened work and rig stores it is handed and the
// routes this process already resolved. It does not decide which rigs are
// serving — a suspended rig is simply absent from the map it is given — and it
// does not decide whether a binding mints truthfully: it asks the store, which
// declares the namespace it mints into. The residence probe nonetheless stays
// in every plan, because retirement also needs a binding known to hold no
// relics and nothing here censuses residents. The corpus already carries the
// retired row, so the day the census ships this is a bit, not a redesign.

// confined to the CONSTRUCTORS: every value in it comes from routes.storeFor,
// which returns what storage boot opened — *SQLiteStore, *BdStore and
// *CachingStore, all pointer-typed and so reference-identified, plus
// refusedClassStore, which is a value carrying one error field.
//
// That last one is comparable rather than reference-identified, and the
// difference is visible: two refusedClassStore values built from the SAME error
// compare equal, so a refused city's five classes group into one binding even
// though storeFor handed back five separate values. That is the answer this
// build wants — a refused city is refused as a whole, and cliSoleClassBinding
// reports one binding for it rather than a five-way fan-out — but it is a
// property of the type being comparable, not of the map being identity-keyed,
// and a second value-typed route with a differing field would group differently
// for the same reason. Same confinement for relocatedGraphLegFrom's
