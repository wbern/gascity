// the sessions class to its own binding, so the controller's work store serves
// zero session beads. liveOpenSessionAssignmentExists issued its gc:session
// label query against that store, got an empty result with no error, and read
// it as "this assignee is dead" — only an actual query *error* fails closed.
//
// Every ~15 minutes the controller reopened live work under live workers:
// bead.dead_assignee_reopened, then ~1s later the session drained as orphaned.
