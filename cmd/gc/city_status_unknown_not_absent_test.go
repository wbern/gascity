// These tests pin one invariant: gc status never states a fact about an agent
// it did not successfully observe. A runtime probe that times out has learned
// nothing, so a running count of zero taken from it is not a measurement and
// must not be published as one — not in the text table, and not in the JSON
// that dashboards and health checks read.
//
// The failure this guards against is expensive rather than cosmetic. A waking
// operator or agent that reads "0/15 agents running" against a queue of open
// work will restart the agents and re-sling the work, which duplicates builds
// that are already mid-review.

// partialFromInjectedProbeTimeout drives the real bounded status provider with
// a probe slow enough to blow its own budget, then reads the partial flag back
// through statusProviderPartial — the same call the snapshot collector makes.
