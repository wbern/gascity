// reapClosedBeadWorktrees discovers per-bead git worktrees under
// cityPath/.gc/worktrees/<rig>/ and removes any whose associated bead is closed
// and that pass every safety gate. It returns a reapReport describing what was
// reaped and what was protected.
//
// Discovery is authoritative at any nesting depth: for each rig it runs
// `git worktree list --porcelain` from the rig's own repository (the repo that
// owns these worktrees, per worktree-setup.sh's `git -C <rig> worktree add`),
// rather than a single-level directory scan. Per-bead worktrees are nested
// under agent-home directories (depth-2, sometimes deeper); the old
// os.ReadDir(.gc/worktrees/<rig>/) scan saw only the agent homes and reaped
// nothing (gastownhall/gascity#4492 root cause A).
//
// Safety gates, in order, all fail closed toward keeping the worktree:
//  1. Named agent-home directories are never removed.
//  2. The bead named by the worktree must exist and be closed.
//  3. Freshness quarantine: a worktree younger than
//     cfg.Daemon.AutoReapClosedBeadWorktreesMinAge is exempt, protecting
//     against the race between worktree creation and its owning bead's
//     work-dir metadata being stamped by the next reconcile pass. An
//     indeterminate age (the ".git" pointer file cannot be stat'd) protects.
//  4. Borrow-veto scan: batched once per rig per tick, this finds any
//     non-terminal bead — in any molecule — whose gc.work_dir/work_dir
//     metadata still points at the worktree's path and protects it if so.
//     A query error protects every remaining candidate in that rig's tick.
//  5. Liveness: no live process cwd and no active-session working directory may
//     sit at or beneath the worktree. If the liveness scan is indeterminate
//     (no /proc), NOTHING is reaped this pass — the reaper cannot prove any
//     tree is idle (root cause B: closed-bead != end-of-use).
//  6. Git state: no uncommitted changes, no unpushed commits, no stashes.
//
// When dryRun is true the reaper performs all discovery and classification and
// emits bead.worktree.reap_skipped events describing what it would reap and
// what it protected, but removes nothing. liveSessionDirs is the active-session
// working-directory set the liveness gate cross-checks against, alongside the
// authoritative /proc cwd scan.
