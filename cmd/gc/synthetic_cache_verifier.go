// syntheticCacheVerifier deduplicates builtinpacks.ValidateSyntheticRepo
// within ONE builtin readiness pass.
//
// Every bundled source of a repository resolves to a single synthetic cache
// directory — the cache key strips the subpath — and ValidateSyntheticRepo
// checks that repository's pack layouts in that directory regardless of which
// of its sources asked. requiredBuiltinSourcesUsable and
// lockedBundledImportsUsable therefore ask the identical question about the
// identical directory, and that question is not cheap: it os.ReadFile's every
// cached pack file and compares it against the copy embedded in the running
// binary.
//
// Only POSITIVE verdicts are memoized, and that is what makes the repair paths
// safe: no verdict about a broken cache is ever recorded, so there is nothing
// stale for a caller to observe after it repairs one. A caller that repaired a
// cache necessarily got its negative verdict from a full validation, and the
// next question about that directory runs a full validation too.
//
// A verifier's own memo map is not safe for concurrent use. For a verifier
// from newSyntheticCacheVerifier that map is also the whole story: it is
// scoped to one readiness pass, so a verdict never outlives the pass that
// produced it, and every pass still runs the full validator at least once,
// which is what detects and repairs a corrupted cache.
//
// newWarmSyntheticCacheVerifier is the cross-pass variant used by the ready
// fast path. Its positive verdicts DO outlive the pass that produced them:
// they are recorded in the process-global warmSyntheticCacheVerdicts and
// gated by a stat fingerprint of the cache tree rather than by the pass
// boundary.

// warmSyntheticCacheVerdicts memoizes POSITIVE full-validation verdicts across
// readiness passes in this process, gated by a cheap stat fingerprint of the
// materialized cache tree (per-file size+mtime+mode and every directory path,
// no content reads).
//
// The ready fast path must still notice a cached pack file that was corrupted
// in place after the city was readied. Re-reading and comparing every cached
// file on every config load is what made that guarantee cost O(pack files) per
// gc command. Any ordinary write to a cached file changes its size or mtime and
// therefore the fingerprint, which forces the full validator to run again and
// repair the cache.
//
// packContentHashCache is the closest sibling, but the analogy needs stating
// carefully in both directions, because the two memos gate different verdicts.
//
// What it memoizes is a content hash, which depends on paths and bytes alone,
// so a size+mtime+ctime fingerprint covers its verdict entirely bar a triple
// collision. What this memoizes is a ValidateSyntheticRepo verdict, which also
// depends on permission bits and on the set of directories — so the sibling's
// fingerprint, applied here unchanged, would leave two gaps it does not have.
// Hashing mode and every directory path closes those two.
//
// One gap remains, and here it is wider than the sibling's rather than equal to
// it: this fingerprint does not hash ctime, so a content edit that preserves
// size and mtime (cp -p, rsync --checksum --times) can still ride a stale
// positive verdict, which #5367 closed for packContentHashCache. Because this
// memo is process-global, that window is a single command for short-lived `gc`
// invocations (the memo starts empty) but the full process lifetime inside a
// long-running supervisor, which calls this boundary directly. Adopting ctime
// here needs internal/config's statCtimeNanos to be shared rather than
// duplicated, so it is deliberately left as follow-up work.

// syntheticCacheStatFingerprint hashes the shape of the tree under dir --
// every entry's path, plus each file's size, modification time and permission
// bits -- reading no file contents.
//
// The entries mirror what ValidateSyntheticRepo rejects, because anything it
// rejects that this cannot see would ride a stale positive verdict:
//
//   - Permission bits are hashed because validatePackFiles fails a file whose
//     mode differs from the embedded copy, and chmod moves ctime rather than
//     mtime or size. The bundled bd shim (gc-beads-bd.sh) is materialized
//     0o755 and exec'd, so a cleared executable bit is a real breakage.
//   - Directories are hashed by path alone because
//     validateSyntheticRepoFileSet rejects an unexpected directory whatever
//     its timestamps, and an added directory need contain no files at all. Its
//     own mtime is deliberately not hashed: it moves whenever a child is
//     written, which that child's own entry already covers, so hashing it
//     would invalidate the memo spuriously.
//
// Entries are tagged "f"/"d" so a file and a directory sharing a path across
// materializations cannot hash alike. This remains stat-only, so the cost is
// unchanged from hashing size and mtime.
