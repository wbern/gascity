// This file covers ga-qi9km: `gc rig add` and `gc supervisor run` silently
// rewrite a city's .beads/metadata.json from embedded to server, re-pointing
// the scope at a database that does not hold its beads, after which every
// work-store read answers `[]` with exit 0.
//
// What landed first is the half that is DECIDABLE: the rewrite becomes visible,
// with the path it stops reading and the durable remediation attached.
//
// ga-clsfl then closed the read-time half — as a NOTICE, never a refusal. The
// two experiment tests near the end of this file are why: they are the cases a
// refusal keyed on "a `.dolt` directory exists under the other mode's
// subdirectory" gets wrong, and that fact is the only evidence available
// without opening the second database. They now double as the acceptance
// tests for the notice, since a notice must leave every one of their answers
// exactly as it found them.
//
// Both fixtures are real directories with real files. The defect survived a
// suite that passes precisely because it lives in the disagreement between a
// JSON file and a directory listing, and a double for either one asserts the
// bug away.

// embeddedScopeWithBeads builds a scope whose .beads/ is an embedded-mode bd
// workspace with a Dolt repository under it — what `bd init -p <prefix>` leaves
// behind, and what the live proof's city had before gc touched it.
//
// The Dolt repository is represented by the directory shape gc itself uses to
// recognize one (a `.dolt` subdirectory, the same test gc doctor's
// doltReposUnder applies). Standing up a real Dolt server to prove a
// path-and-JSON disagreement would test Dolt, not this.
