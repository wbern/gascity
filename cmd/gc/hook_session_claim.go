// halves of the claim back-channel: `gc hook --claim` stamps the claimed bead id
// onto the calling session's bead through it, and `gc hook current` reads that
// stamp back through it.
//
// It routes through cliSessionFrontDoor so a [beads.classes.sessions] relocation
// reaches both halves — a raw work-store front door would stamp the claim onto
// the work store while the real session bead lives in the relocated store, and
// `gc hook current` would then read back nothing forever. The no-refresh config
// loader matches the other hook-path roots (cmd_prime.go's
// persistPrimeHookProviderSessionKey): this runs on every claim, and a nil cfg
// leaves cliSessionStore identity to the input store.

// EXACTLY and refuses a non-session bead before writing anything: bd's fuzzy id
// resolver would otherwise let a post-claim update land on a prefix-colliding
// session if the intended one disappeared concurrently, which is why the claim
// path decorates the session bead only through this guarded seam (see
// publishHookClaimRunMap, which stays a file-based sidecar for exactly that

// re-run issues no write once the value is current.

// The SESSION ROW is the source, not provider meta. `gc runtime drain-check`
// reads GC_DRAIN, which reconciler-tracked drains never set, so a provider-meta
// probe would miss the whole keyed population this fence exists for. It reads
// through the same routed front door the claim back-channel writes through, so a
// [beads.classes.sessions] relocation reaches the fence too.
//
// Any state OTHER than draining — including a closed row, whose runtime state
// GetState reports as empty — is not this fence's business. A closed or
// superseded incarnation is the runtime-identity fence's stale-session lane, and
// answering false here leaves that lane's verdict intact rather than relabelling
// it. Errors are returned rather than swallowed: the caller fails OPEN on them,
// and it can only make that choice if it can see them.
