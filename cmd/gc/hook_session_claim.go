// stamp back through it.
//
// It routes through cliSessionFrontDoor so a [beads.classes.sessions] relocation
// reaches both halves — a raw work-store front door would stamp the claim onto
// the work store while the real session bead lives in the relocated store, and
// `gc hook current` would then read back nothing forever. The no-refresh config
// loader matches the other hook-path roots (cmd_prime.go's
// persistPrimeHookProviderSessionKey): this runs on every claim, and a nil cfg
// leaves cliSessionStore identity to the input store.

// GetState reports as empty — is not this fence's business. A closed or

// ephemeral, is running in a shared slot directory for exactly the same gc-j0cfh
