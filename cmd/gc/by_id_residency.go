package main

// The one-shot CLI's by-id residency seam.
//
// Every one-shot command that holds a bead id and a work store asks the same
// question — "which store actually holds this bead?" — and before the residency
// resolver each asked it in its own words. That is the split-store bug class
// (#5125, #5127): the ordering, the identity gate, the namespace rule and the
// failure classification are four clauses, and every restatement is a chance to
// get one of them wrong.
//
// # The plane keeps its work axis; the resolver owns the binding legs
//
// The CLI's structural difference from internal/api is that its work axis is
// often not a beads.Store at all: `gc bd`'s fall-through is a bd subprocess,
// and the convoy surface's is a directory scan with a uniqueness contract of
// its own. So this seam does not try to own the work half. It hands the plan a
// work leg and reads back storeref's residual contract: the LAST
// RoleWorkFallback leg is returned UNPROBED, which means "no binding answered —
// run your own work axis". A caller whose work axis IS a store passes that
// store and uses the answer directly; a caller whose work axis is a subprocess
// or a scan asks only the binding half, through storeref.ResolveBindingOwner,
// and reads its ok=false as the signal to fall through.
//
// That residual is also what keeps a single-store city byte-identical: its plan
// has one leg, nothing is probed, and the caller gets back the exact store value
// it passed in — so every optional-capability type assertion it already made
// keeps holding, and it never pays for the funnel.

// cliByIDOwner resolves id over the city's relocated class bindings and the
// caller's own work leg, returning the row a winning binding probe already read.
//
// The plan is Plan(ByID) over a topology of {bindings: cliResidencyBindings,
// work: the caller's leg} with NO rig legs. That absence is deliberate and is
// the pre-resolver behavior preserved: none of these call sites ever read the
// rig stores, and a caller that starts reading them here would silently change
// which beads its command is about. storeref carries rigs as Shadows for the
// surfaces that already hold them open (internal/api's by-id resolver); this one
// passes none, and an empty Shadows list is what keeps the probe order the
// [binding, work] the pre-seam list used.
//
// cfg is nil for the same reason the legacy route never loaded one: the only
// thing a City would contribute here is the work and rig id prefixes, which
// decide SHADOWING — and with no rig legs there is nothing to shadow.
//
// An error is a read that FAILED, never absence. Reading "the binding could not
// answer" as "the bead is not there" is the root-loss shape this lane exists to
// prevent. The one error that is not always a fault is the one-shot funnel's
// standing refusal: it is a verdict about a CITY's storage configuration and
// says nothing about a bead, and a refused city still serves WORK from its work
// ledger. The resolver applies that distinction from the leg's own role — the
// authority leg for an id inside a reserved namespace surfaces the refusal,
// because there the refusal IS the answer, while a residence probe for an id no
// relocated class could own tolerates it.
//
// That toleration is conditional, and the condition is a relic census proving
// the binding holds ids the migration preserved. Then the probe's miss is not
// harmless — the work store's frozen pre-migration copy is what the caller
// falls through to — so the refusal is surfaced there too, wrapped by
// withProvenRelicRemedy with the move that clears it.
