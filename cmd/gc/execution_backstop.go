// The execution backstop: a claim that never becomes execution.
//
// Every backstop that came before this one ends at the CLAIM. nudgeStalledPoolClaims
// clears the instant its trigger bead flips to in_progress ("the slot is doing
// its job"), and nudgeStalledPoolContinuations only ever looks at the OPEN
// successor of a step that already completed. So the one state neither covers is
// the one the incident produced: a pool slot holding an in-progress bead, idle at
// its prompt, having claimed and then ended its turn without starting the work.
// From there nothing in the fleet converges — the bead is not open, so no claim
// probe wants it; the session is alive, so no crash lane touches it — until the
// session is recycled 15-85 minutes later and the dead-assignee reopen releases
// the claim.
//
// This predicate closes that with the same bounded shape as its two siblings:
// observe, nudge, back off, give up. It re-delivers the agent's OWN configured
// claim nudge, which is idempotent by construction — re-running `gc hook --claim`
// on a bead this session already owns returns action=work
// reason=existing_assignment (the ga-i44k invariant), so a slot that was merely
// slow re-reads its assignment instead of being handed a second one.
//
// # The churn guard is provider idleness, and it is the predicate's job
//
// The shared engine does not consult the runtime; it keys purely on bead state.
// That is enough for the sibling predicates, because their outstanding condition
// (a bead still OPEN) is structurally invisible to a working agent — the moment
// it claims, the predicate stops matching. This one's condition is the exact
// opposite: an in-progress bead is what a working agent looks like. So the
// predicate holds unless the runtime itself reports no activity for at least the
// grace window, and an UNKNOWN activity signal (an error, or a runtime that
// reports none) holds too. That is the #312 lesson stated in the one place it
// applies: never nudge on "we cannot tell".
//
// # Exhaustion hands the session to a lane that already converges
//
// At the attempt cap the stall becomes a typed event and the session is handed
// to the ordinary drain path, whose recycle -> dead-assignee-reopen chain is the
// one that converges today — only now in a bounded ~11 minutes rather than on
// recycle roulette. Restart-with-backoff is established framework liveness (the
// same shape as health patrol); the decision about the WORK is still the agent's.
// The escalation is latched on the session bead so it fires once per stalled
// claim, not once per tick.
