## Setup

First, you'll need to install at least one CLI coding agent (which Gas City
calls "providers") and make sure that they're on the PATH. Gas City supports
many providers, including but not limited to Claude Code (`claude`), Codex
(`codex`) and Gemini (`gemini`). Make sure you've configured each of your chosen
providers (the more the merrier!) with the appropriate token and/or API key so
that they can each run and do things for you.

Next, you'll need to get the Gas City CLI installed and on your PATH:

```shell
~
$ brew install gascity
...

~
$ gc version
0.13.4
```

> NOTE: the gascity installation is a great way to get the right dependencies in
> place, but may not be enough to keep up with the changes we're making on the
> way to 1.0. Best practice right now is to build your own `gc` binary from HEAD
> on the `main` branch of [the gascity
> repo](https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity) to get the latest and greatest
> bits before running these tutorials.

Now we're ready to create our first city.

## Creating a city

A city is a directory that holds your agent configuration, prompts, and
workflows. You create a new city with `gc init`:

```shell

~
$ gc init ~/my-city
Welcome to Gas City SDK!

Choose a config template:
  1. minimal   — default coding agent (default)
  2. gastown   — multi-agent orchestration pack
  3. custom    — empty workspace, configure it yourself

  Starting agents...

~
$ gc cities
NAME        PATH
my-city     /Users/csells/my-city
```

You can avoid the prompts and just specify what provider you want. Here's the
same command, just providing the provider explicitly.

```shell
~
$ gc init ~/my-city --provider claude
```

Gas City created the city directory, registered it, and started it. A city
created with `gc init` comes with `pack.toml`, `city.toml`, and the standard
top-level directories, so let's look at what's inside:

```shell
~
$ cd ~/my-city

~/my-city
$ ls
agents  assets  city.toml  commands  doctor  formulas  orders  overlays  pack.toml  template-fragments
```

At the top level of the city directory:

- `pack.toml` — the portable pack definition layer
- `city.toml` — city-local deployment and runtime settings

This city comes with a built-in `mayor` agent. The mayor's prompt lives at
`agents/mayor/prompt.template.md`, and `pack.toml` defines the always-on mayor
session that uses it. Assuming you chose the default `minimal` config
template and default provider, `city.toml` keeps the city-local runtime
settings:

```shell
~/my-city
$ cat city.toml
[workspace]
name = "my-city"
provider = "claude"
```

The portable pack definition lives next to it:

```shell
~/my-city
$ cat pack.toml
[pack]
name = "my-city"
schema = 2

[[agent]]
name = "mayor"
prompt_template = "agents/mayor/prompt.template.md"

[[named_session]]
template = "mayor"
mode = "always"
```

The `[workspace]` section names your city and sets the default provider.

The `[[agent]]` entry in `pack.toml` defines the built-in `mayor`, and
`[[named_session]]` keeps a `mayor` session running so you can talk to it at
any time. When you add more agents later, Gas City creates `agents/<name>/`, with
`prompt.template.md` for the prompt and `agent.toml` for any per-agent
overrides.

Gas City also gives you an implicit agent for each supported provider — so
`claude`, `codex`, and `gemini` are available as agent names even though they're
not listed in `pack.toml`. These use the provider's defaults with no custom
prompt.

To check on the status of your city, use `gc status`:

```shell
~/my-project
$ gc status
my-city  /Users/csells/my-city
  Controller: standalone-managed (PID 83621)
  Authority: standalone controller PID 83621
  Next: gc stop /Users/csells/my-city && gc start /Users/csells/my-city to hand ownership to the supervisor
  Suspended:  no

Agents:
  dog                     pool (min=0, max=3)

    dog-2                 stopped
    dog-3                 stopped
  mayor                   pool (min=0, max=unlimited)
  claude                  pool (min=0, max=unlimited)
  my-project/claude       pool (min=0, max=unlimited)

1/4 agents running

Rigs:
  my-project              /Users/csells/my-project

Sessions: 2 active, 0 suspended
```

## Adding a rig

In Gas City, a project directory registered with a city is called a "rig."
Rigging a project's directory lets agents work in it.

```shell
~/my-city
$ gc rig add ~/my-project
Adding rig 'my-project'...
  Prefix: mp
  Initialized beads database
  Generated routes.jsonl for cross-rig routing
  Registered in global rig index
Rig added.
```

Gas City derived the rig name from the directory basename (`my-project`) and set
up work tracking in it. You can see the new entry in `city.toml`:

```shell

~/my-city
$ cat city.toml
[workspace]
name = "my-city"
provider = "claude"

... # content elided

[[rigs]]
name = "my-project"
path = "/Users/csells/my-project"
```

You can also see your city's rigs with `gc rig list`:

```shell
~/my-project
$ gc rig list

Rigs in /Users/csells/my-city:

  my-city (HQ):
    Prefix: mc
    Beads:  initialized

  my-project:
    Path:   /Users/csells/my-project
    Prefix: mp
    Beads:  initialized
```

## Slinging your first work

You assign work to agents by "slinging" it — think of it as tossing a task to
someone who knows what to do. To sling work on a rig, the easiest way to do
that is from inside a rig directory. The `gc sling` command takes an agent name
and a prompt. Gas City figures out which rig and city you're in based on your
current working directory:

```shell
~/my-city
$ cd ~/my-project

~/my-project
$ gc sling claude "Add a README.md with a project description"
Created mp-ff9 — "Add a README.md with a project description"
Attached wisp mp-6yh (default formula "mol-do-work") to mp-ff9
Auto-convoy mp-4tl
Slung mp-ff9 → my-project/claude
```

Notice that the work was splung (slinged?) to `my-project/claude` — the agent is
tasked with work to do in this rig.

The `gc sling` command created a work item in our city (called a "bead") and
dispatched it to the `claude` agent. You can watch it progress:

```shell
~/my-city
$ bd show mp-ff9 --watch
✓ mp-ff9 · Write hello world in python to the file hello.py   [P2 · CLOSED]
Owner: Chris Sells · Assignee: claude-mp-208 · Type: task
Created: 2026-04-07 · Updated: 2026-04-07

NOTES
Done: created project README.md

PARENT
  ↑ ○ mp-6yh: sling-mp-ff9 P2

Watching for changes... (Press Ctrl+C to exit)
```

Once the bead moves to `CLOSED`, you can see the results:

```shell
~/my-project
$ ls
README.md
```

Success! You just dispatched work to an AI agent and gotten results back.

## What's next

You've created a city, slung work to agents, added a project as a rig, and slung
work to that rig. From here:

- **[Agents](/tutorials/02-agents)** — go deeper on agent configuration:
  prompts, sessions, scope, working directories
- **[Sessions](/tutorials/03-sessions)** — interactive conversations with
  agents, polecats and crew
- **[Formulas](/tutorials/05-formulas)** — multi-step workflow templates with
  dependencies and variables
