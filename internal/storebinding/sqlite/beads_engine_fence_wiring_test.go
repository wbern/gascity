// That the fence storebinding.EngineReservedPrefixes computes is the fence the
// opened store actually enforces.
//
// The rows over in storebinding pin what that function returns. They cannot see
// whether the return value ever reaches the store: deleting the
// WithSQLiteStoreReservedIDPrefixes option from OpenEngine leaves every one of
// them green and ships a binding that accepts any pinned id at all — the exact
// state the fence was added to end. The rows here go through OpenEngine and ask
// the store, which is the only place that question has an answer.
