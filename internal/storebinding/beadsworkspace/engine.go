// The serving half of the beads workspace provider: how a planned binding
// becomes the store the class front doors read and write through.
//
// The engine is not chosen here, and that is the design rather than an
// omission. This opens a workspace directory through the linked beads library;
// the library reads the workspace's own configuration and serves it with
// whichever backend that configuration names. Nothing in this file branches on
// the answer, so a workspace served by a backend the linked library gains
// later needs no edit here.
