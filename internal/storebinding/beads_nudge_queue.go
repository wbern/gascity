// The durable nudge queue as BEADS. Every other storage class is already a
// projection of one canonical Beads store; the queue was the last front door
// with no Beads-backed implementation, so NewBeadsAdapters had to be handed a
// queue built on some other substrate. This file closes that gap: one queued
// nudge is one bead, and the same code path runs over the SQLite engine, over
// a Postgres beads store, or over anything else that carries the same
// compare-and-swap primitives.
//
// TWO ORTHOGONAL AXES, ONE AUTHORITY EACH. A queued nudge has four observable
// states (pending, in-flight, dead, terminal), and mapping four states onto a
// single field is what makes queues lose work. So they are split:
//
//   - The lifecycle axis (live | dead | terminal) lives in metadata
//     "queue_state" and is moved only by a revision-fenced UpdateIfMatch.
//   - The delivery axis (pending | in-flight) lives in the bead's ASSIGNEE,
//     which holds the claim lease, and is moved only by Claim (acquire) and
//     ReleaseIfCurrent (release).
//
// A live bead is in-flight exactly while its assignee carries an unexpired
// lease. That is why the lease deadline is IN the assignee rather than in
// metadata: Claim writes owner and deadline in one atomic swap, so there is no
// window in which an item is claimed but not yet leased — a window in which a
// concurrent recovery pass would revoke a fresh claim. It also means an
// expired lease releases by arithmetic, not by a write that might never
// happen: the item reads as pending the instant its deadline passes, whether
// or not any maintenance pass has run.
//
// SINGLE WINNER. ClaimDue mints a fresh lease token per call, so two racing
// claimants never present the same assignee and Claim's idempotent self-claim
// cannot hand the same item to both. The CAS is the gate; the metadata read
// that follows only rejects an item that raced into the dead bucket.
//
// The queue's beads are its own family (label "gc:nudge-queue"), disjoint from
// the nudge SHADOW beads that internal/nudgequeue projects over the same store
// (label "gc:nudge"). Queue and shadow stay separate records here, unlike the
// merged SQL port; the shadow front door is unchanged.
//
// Policy (lease, backoff, attempt ceiling, dead retention) mirrors the values
// the deployed queue applies. They are duplicated rather than imported because
// the authority lives in cmd/gc, a main package nothing can import; the copies
// are pinned to it by a test that reads its source, which is the only place the
// two may meet.
