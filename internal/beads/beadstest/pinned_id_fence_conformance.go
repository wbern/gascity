// The pinned-id fence, as a PROVIDER contract.
//
// A class binding claims an id namespace, and a store serving one is fenced to
// the namespaces it claims. Minting settles the ids a store GENERATES; it says
// nothing about the ids a caller PINS, and Create honors a pinned id verbatim.
// So an unfenced binding accepts a foreign bead and its namespace claim quietly
// stops holding: the bead is then unreachable by every id-shaped lookup of the
// namespace it actually sits in.
//
// The rows below are behavior a caller can observe, never an implementation. A
// suite that demanded particular error PROSE would be pinning one store's
// wording, which is why every refusal is matched on
// beads.ErrPinnedIDOutsideNamespace.
//
// Half the rows are over-restriction controls, grouped under a subtest that
// says so: each passes on a build with no fence at all, which is the point.
// Without them a store satisfies this suite by refusing every pinned id, and
// the bindings that legitimately pin one — a wisp root, a nudge-queue record, a
// work bead under an operator-configured prefix — stop working.
