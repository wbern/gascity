// Package splittest provides strict, prefix-disjoint bead-store test doubles
// for the work/coordination-class store split.
//
// # Why this package exists
//
// The split-store bug class — code resolving "which store owns this class of
// bead" differently on different paths — is the one this repo keeps paying
// for. beads.MemStore hides it:
//
//   - MemStore.DepAdd appends an edge without resolving either endpoint, so a
//     cross-store dependency succeeds in a test no matter what the backend the
//     test claims to model would have done with it.
//   - MemStore.Create mints over whatever id it was handed, so a graph-prefixed
//     bead can be "created" inside a work store without a peep — and the test
//     never learns that the row it thinks it made does not exist.
//
// StrictStore closes both gaps at the LEAF store, so a policy or class wrapper
// layered on top keeps the checks live on every path (cmd/gc's beadPolicyStore
// does not override DepAdd or Create's id handling — the embedded Store
// interface delegates them straight down).
//
// # Two backends, two answers: pick one per leaf
//
// The two production backends do NOT agree on these operations, so a single
// strictness setting would model one of them and lie about the other. A work
// store runs on bd/Dolt, which hard-fails; a relocated coordination class runs
// on SQLite (internal/storebinding/sqlite/beads_engine.go OpenEngine opens
// beads.OpenSQLiteStore with the class's reserved prefix), which accepts
// silently and corrupts instead. Semantics selects which one a leaf models —
// [BdSemantics] for [NewWorkStore], [SQLiteSemantics] for [NewClassStore] —
// and every rule below names the backend it is modeling.
//
// One rule names none, and that is the point of it: the pinned-id FENCE is a
// property of the class binding, so both backends enforce it identically and
// both semantics do too. A leaf is fenced when it is given namespaces; see
// pinned_id_fence.go.

// resolves both endpoints and returns "resolving issue ID %s: no issue found

// passed through unresolved as a cross-prefix ref. Sources for the SQLite

//
// # Accepted is not unnoticed
//
// A SQLiteSemantics leaf accepting a violation is the point: the row or edge
// lands, so the test sees what production sees — a dangling edge drops its
// dependent out of Ready rather than erroring. But the violation is recorded,
// and the kit's constructors fail the test at cleanup for any violation the
// fixture did not claim with [TakeResidenceViolations]. A fixture asserting the
// production corruption claims them; every other fixture goes red.
//
// # Tier transparency is a requirement, not a bonus
//
// Production molecules materialize as ephemeral wisps carrying pinned
// <prefix>-wisp-<suffix> ids, not store-minted main-tier ids. A double that
// clobbers explicit ids cannot express the wisp tier at all, so the kit's
// leaves honor a pinned in-prefix id (beads.MemStore.HonorExplicitIDs) and the
// strict wrapper is otherwise tier-transparent: ephemeral beads create, read,
// and dep-link through it exactly as through the leaf. Fixtures still have to
// ASK for the wisp tier the way tier-aware production code does
// (ListQuery.TierMode / ReadyQuery.TierMode set to beads.TierWisps or
// beads.TierBoth); the kit is a leaf-level pair with no policy wrapper
// expanding reads.

//
// A leaf that exposes no prefix — beads.MemStore cannot, because its IDPrefix
// is a field and Go forbids a method of the same name; beads.BdStore and
// beads.SQLiteStore report "" when opened without one — fails the test here
// rather than producing a store called strict whose residence checks have no
// namespace to be about. Use StrictWithPrefix to declare the namespace for
// those leaves.
//
// Wrap the LEAF store, not a policy wrapper: cmd/gc's beadPolicyStore does not
// override DepAdd, so a strict leaf keeps the dependency check live on every
// path through the policy stack, while a strict wrapper AROUND the policy store
// would be bypassed by any code holding the inner store.
//
// Capability forwarding: production code discovers optional store capabilities
// by direct type-assertion, and an interface-embedding wrapper silently strips
// everything outside beads.Store. StrictStore forwards Handles (with a strict
// Writer), IDPrefix, graph-apply and conditional writes (via the
// beads.GraphApplyHandleProvider / beads.ConditionalWriterHandleProvider
// handles, so beads.GraphApplyFor and beads.ConditionalWriterFor keep working
// without a false claim), the conditional-writes resolve target, Counter,
// ConditionalAssignmentReleaser, BatchDeleter, ForeignIDCreator, DepListBatch,
// DepMetadata, CloseStore, AtomicTx, Backing, and WaitForParentProjection.
// StorageCreateStore is forwarded only when the leaf implements it (a
// capability-preserving variant type), so the wrapper never falsely claims
// CreateWithStorage for leaves without it — the storage-policy fallback in
// cmd/gc must keep firing for MemStore leaves.
//
// Deliberately dropped: beads.StorageGraphApplyStore (asserted on the
// graph-apply HANDLE, which is forwarded verbatim, never on the store itself)
// and any bd-only unexported surfaces. Graph-apply plans bypass the strict
// DepAdd guard by construction: a plan's nodes and edges land atomically in ONE
// store, and real appliers validate edges internally; MemStore leaves have no
// applier at all. Create-time deps (beads.Bead.Needs) are also left
// unstrictened: molecule step Needs carry formula step refs, not bead ids, on
// some fixture paths, and bd's --deps validation behavior is not pinned by a
// contract test, so enforcing here would reject valid fixtures rather than
// catch real cross-store bugs.
