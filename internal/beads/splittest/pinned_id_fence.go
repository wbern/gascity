// The pinned-id fence, as the kit models it.
//
// A store serving a class binding is fenced to the namespaces that binding
// claims: minting settles the ids a store GENERATES, and Create honors a pinned
// id verbatim, so an unfenced binding accepts a foreign bead and its namespace
// claim quietly stops holding. Both shipped providers apply the rule
// (internal/storebinding/sqlite and .../beadsworkspace both pass
// storebinding.EngineReservedPrefixes into the store option), which is why the
// kit's class leaves have to apply it too — a leaf that accepted what the real
// binding refuses is green on writes production would have rejected.
//
// This is a SECOND spelling of internal/beads/pinned_id_fence.go's rule, and
// that file's own doc says a second spelling is how two fences drift apart.
// Exporting beads.checkPinnedIDNamespace instead would be cheap — internal/beads
// is repo-private, so nothing outside the module would see it — and would delete
// this file. It is spelled twice anyway because the kit is a MODEL of the two
// backends, and a model that calls the thing it models cannot disagree with it,
// which is the one failure the class-store double exists to make visible.
//
// What keeps the two spellings together is therefore not the code but the
// contract: this leaf runs against beadstest.RunPinnedIDFenceConformance, the
// same provider suite the shipped stores run (see fence_conformance_test.go). A
// divergence fails that suite here exactly as it would fail it there — on every
// axis the suite covers, which is the standing bound on this trade.
//
// The rules below are the ones the conformance suite pins, in its words:
// membership is tested on the SEPARATOR (plain containment admits "gcnx-1",
// which belongs to no binding at all), on the id EXACTLY as it will be stored
// (trimming first certifies a membership the persisted row does not have), and
// with case folded but not rewritten. An empty id is a MINT request rather than
// a pin, and an empty namespace set leaves the store unfenced — the shipped
// default everywhere the store is not a class binding.
