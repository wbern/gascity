// atomically advances the generation key by one AND applies onSuccess
// (typically execution identity: Assignee, DirectSessionID/SessionName
// metadata, Status) in a single revision-fenced write.
//
// The generation bump and onSuccess are folded into one
// beads.ConditionalWriter.UpdateIfMatch call, fenced on the bead's revision as
// observed by this call's own Get. UpdateIfMatch applies opts only if the
// bead's revision still equals that snapshot; otherwise the whole write is
// rejected atomically (*beads.PreconditionFailedError), so there is no window
// in which a second claimant's write can land between the generation CAS and
// the effects write the way a two-step CAS-then-Update could race. A store
// that exposes no beads.ConditionalWriter (beads.ConditionalWriterFor returns
// ok=false), or one whose ConditionalWriter is disabled for this instance,
// fails closed with beads.ErrConditionalWriteUnsupported rather than
// downgrading to an unconditional write.
//
// This is the scheduler-owned counterpart to the generic gc hook --claim pool
// path: it never falls back to an unconditional write when the store lacks
// conditional-write support, and it never retries against a different bead.
// A stale or conflicting caller gets ClaimExactStale (or an error, for a store
// that cannot conditionally write at all) and must re-read and re-decide;
// ClaimExact will not silently hand it a different ready bead the way a
// generic pool claim would.
//
// onSuccess.Metadata must not set beadmeta.ClaimGenerationMetadataKey; doing
// so returns ErrClaimGenerationReserved without writing anything.
