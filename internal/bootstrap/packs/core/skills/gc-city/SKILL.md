# City Lifecycle

A city is a directory containing `city.toml` and `.gc/` runtime state.

## Initialization

```
gc init                                # Initialize city in current directory
gc init <path>                         # Initialize city at path
```

## Starting and stopping

```
gc start                               # Start city under the supervisor
gc start <path>                        # Start city at path under the supervisor
gc supervisor run                      # Run the supervisor in the foreground
gc start --dry-run                     # Preview what would start
gc stop                                # Stop the current city
gc restart                             # Stop then start
```

`gc init` and `gc start` register the city with the machine supervisor,
ensure it is running, and trigger an immediate reconcile. Interactive
sessions are created separately with `gc session new <template>`.

## Status

```
gc status                              # City-wide overview
gc session list                        # Session / agent status
gc rig status <name>                   # Rig status
```

## Suspending

```
gc suspend                             # Suspend entire city
gc resume                              # Resume suspended city
```

## Configuration

```
gc config show                         # Show resolved configuration
gc config explain                      # Show config layering and provenance
gc doctor                              # Run health checks
```

## Events

```
gc events                              # Tail the event log
gc event emit <type> [data]            # Emit a custom event
```

## Dashboard

See the gc-dashboard skill for full dashboard reference.

## Packs

Packs extend Gas City with additional commands, prompts, formulas, and
doctor checks. Pack commands appear as top-level `gc <pack> <command>`
subcommands.

```
gc pack list                           # List installed packs
gc pack fetch                          # Fetch remote packs
```
