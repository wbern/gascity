// Package workrecord holds the ADR-0009 work-record close contract: the rule
// that closing a work bead must leave a typed, machine-checkable record of what
// the work produced.
//
// The bead must carry a typed gc.work_outcome, and a "shipped" outcome must
// point at a commit that is reachable on the stamped gc.work_branch. This turns
// the recurring "drain-without-commit" close (a close that leaves no artifact at
// all) into a machine-checkable violation.
//
// The contract ships warn-only by default — violations are logged but the close
// proceeds — so existing open beads migrate without breakage. Set
// GC_WORK_RECORD_ENFORCE to a truthy value to make violations block the close.
//
// # Why this is a package and not a CLI detail
//
// A bead closes through more than one per-bead door: `gc bd close` and
// `gc bd update --status closed` on the CLI plane, POST /v0/bead/{id}/close and
// a closed-status POST /v0/bead/{id}/update (or its PATCH /v0/bead/{id} alias)
// on the HTTP plane. Every such door has to ask the same question of the same
// population, or the ungated door becomes the way closes get done. Bulk
// teardown — the paths that close a whole workflow root or scope at once
// through beads.Store.CloseAll — is deliberately not a door in this sense, on
// either plane; see humaHandleBeadDelete in internal/api for the rationale that
// covers it. This package owns the question — which beads the contract
// covers, what a valid record looks like, whether enforcement is on — and each
// plane owns only its own plumbing: argv projection and stderr in cmd/gc, the
// resolved owner store and the 409 in internal/api.
