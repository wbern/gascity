// Package storeref resolves a bead id to the store that physically owns it,
// across the work store and the relocated coordination-class SQLite stores.
//
// It is the standalone successor to coordrouter.Router's by-id read federation
// (prefixBackendForID + Get): the Router is the live graph_store=sqlite wiring
// today and is retired in the final phase of the infra/beads split, so this
// package carries the same routing forward over an explicit []beads.Store the
// caller assembles, with no central Router.
//
// # Ids are NOT prefix-disjoint across stores
//
// A bead is resident in exactly one store, but its id namespace can be claimed
// by more than one: config.ValidateRigs rejects duplicate prefixes and nothing
// else, and it deliberately does NOT reject a reserved coordination-class
// prefix on an HQ or rig work store — config.ReservedPrefixWarnings warns and
// allows it. So a work store can mint and hold ids inside a relocated class's
// namespace, and every resolver here PROBES a candidate list rather than
// assuming one store owns a prefix outright.
//
// # Two namespace predicates, deliberately different
//
//   - IDInNamespace (class_candidates.go) matches a CONFIGURED prefix — a
//     rig/HQ prefix or a reserved class prefix — and admits the bare id, because
//     a configured prefix can be a whole id.
//   - PrefixOwner matches a store's SELF-DECLARED IDPrefix() and requires the
//     "prefix-" separator, because a store that mints "gcg-1" never mints "gcg".
//
// Collapsing them would let a bare id capture a store that cannot hold it. Use
// the one whose prefix source matches where your prefix came from.

// Resolve federates a point read over a bare store LIST.
//
// # Superseded: do not add callers
//
// It has no callers outside this package's own tests. Every by-id read in the
// tree now plans ByID over a Topology and executes it with ResolveOwnerRow,
// which is not a stylistic preference: the PrefixOwner step below routes on the
// id's OWN prefix, ahead of whatever order the caller assembled its list in, and
// `gc storage migrate` copies-and-retains while PRESERVING ids. So for every
// infrastructure bead minted before a cutover — which keeps its work-era prefix
// — this function returns the work store and the caller reads the frozen
// pre-migration row, successfully, with status and revision as of the cutover
// and no error to notice (ga-cu12x). A plan has no such fast path: the binding
// leads for an id inside its reserved namespace and every unretired binding is
// probed ahead of work for an id inside none.
//
// It survives as the executor the plan's contract is compared against
// (the leg-order and hard-failure rows in this package's tests) and because
// deleting it would delete that comparison.
//
// The mechanics: a bead lives in exactly one store, so it tries
// the prefix owner first (the cheap, fork-free path) and falls back to probing
// every store in turn, returning the first hit. It preserves the first hard
// (non-ErrNotFound) read failure seen across the owner probe and the fallback
// scan, returning beads.ErrNotFound only when every probe was a clean not-found.
// A hard failure means an authoritative store was unavailable, which must never
// be flattened into a clean miss — otherwise an unreachable owner store looks
// identical to a deleted bead. Mirrors coordrouter.Router.Get's multi-backend
// body, so it is a drop-in for the Router's by-id read once the Router is deleted.
