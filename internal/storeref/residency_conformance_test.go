// resolver and pinned here as the artifact both the demand side and the claim
// side of a migration slice assert against. A slice that changes a leg order,
// drops a leg, or re-derives an error policy changes a row, and the diff is the
// review.

// The failure signatures are deliberately distinct (§6): a MIS-ORDERED plan
// fails this golden diff and nothing else, while a MISSING LEG additionally
// fails the reader-agreement property in residency_agreement_test.go. Both
// facts are asserted as controls below, so a golden regeneration cannot quietly
