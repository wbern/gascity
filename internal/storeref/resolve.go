package storeref

// The residency resolver: one authority for "which stores answer this
// question?"
//
// The typed-store split shipped a PLACEMENT contract — every class has exactly
// one authoritative accessor for "which store OWNS creates of class C"
// (cmd/gc/class_store.go's resolveClassStore). It never shipped a LOOKUP
// contract, and lookup was answered instead at ~90 call sites, each assembling
// its own store list from two binding-blind base enumerators plus a per-site
// re-derivation of the identity gate, the leg order, the dedupe rule and the
// fail-loud policy. Conventions do not survive 90 call sites: the census counted
// 31 restatements in the query class alone, and each restatement was a chance to
// get one clause wrong.
//
// So the rules live here, once, each with the incident that proved it:
//
//   ByID, id inside a binding's reserved namespace
//     [binding, work, shadows most-specific-first]. The binding leads because
//     it is the sole MINTER of the namespace — but minting is not holding, and
//     a reserved prefix is only ADVISORY on work stores, so the list is PROBED
//     and never routed (#5128).
//
//   ByID, id outside every reserved namespace
//     [binding as a residence probe, work, shadows]. `gc storage migrate`
//     preserves ids, so a relocated bead keeps its work-era prefix; nil from
//     the namespace gate means "cannot decide", never "work owns it"
//     (ga-axin6/#5245, #5132). Retired per ClassBinding.MintsReserved. The
//     probe tolerates a standing refusal, because a refused city still serves
//     work — unless the binding is PROVEN to hold such relics, where skipping
//     it falls back to the migration's frozen copy rather than to nothing
//     (ga-q8ick).
//
//   ByID, single-store city
//     [work], returned unprobed. The identity fast-path: a city that relocates
//     nothing pays nothing for a seam it cannot use.
//
//   RoutedWork
//     [work, rigs ascending, binding LAST], first-leg-wins dedupe (#5148).
//     Binding-last is what keeps a co-resident id answering from work, so the
//     demand surface agrees with the claim surface.
//
//   AssignedWork, claim escalation
//     work legs FIRST, binding last, escalating only on a PROVEN all-work-legs
//     not-found. Deliberately the OPPOSITE order to ByID for a co-resident id:
//     the claim must land where the reader serves from (#5148/#5158/#5161,
//     ga-bvdha). The asymmetry is a documented property of the intent PAIR,
//     not a per-site accident.
//
//   AssignedWork, sweeps (gates, releases, re-wake)
//     work + rigs + EVERY binding, as a union. A work-led scan cannot see
//     claim-routed assignees (ga-whzrt, and the sibling sweeps that lacked the
//     leg).
//
//   Session
//     [sessions binding, work, rigs] as a union. Single-leg SUBSTITUTION is the
//     session-verb blindness: graph-run session beads in work stores and
//     pre-relocation residue are both real (#5187 lineage).
//
//   Census
//     work AND rigs AND every binding, each a DISTINCT ref'd leg. The binding
//     must not REPLACE the city work leg — the accidental dual role that let a
//     city-scope routed work bead go invisible to the controller tick.
//
//   Class
//     exactly one leg: the binding serving the class, else work. The placement
//     contract, unchanged.
//
// What the resolver is NOT: an I/O layer (it opens nothing and caches nothing),
// a per-class fan-out engine (Topology can EXPRESS a per-class split and the
// corpus asserts it, but no constructor in this build produces one), and a
// judgment holder (leg order and error policy are transport facts).

// caller's own axis owns is not. The stop reads the leg's role rather than its
// position, because the residual is not always there to stop at: dedupeLegs
// removes it on a city whose binding resolved back to the work store, and the
// shadows behind it stay.
//
// A read fault is still an error rather than a decline: a binding that could
// not answer has said nothing about the id, and turning that into "no binding
// owns it" sends the caller straight at the frozen copy.
