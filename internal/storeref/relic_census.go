// The relic census: does this binding still hold a bead that only a probe can
// find?
//
// A class migration copies rows across with their ORIGINAL ids
// (beads.ForeignIDCreator), so a converged city's binding holds a population of
// work-shaped ids no reader can locate from the id alone. That population is
// the whole reason ClassBinding.HasLegacyResidents exists, and it is a
// LIVE-STATE question, not a config or manifest one. The migration manifest
// records an ACT, not the binding's contents: it is absent on a city migrated
// by another build, incomplete on one restored from a backup, and silent about
// anything written to the binding by other means. Trusting it would retire a
// probe over beads that are sitting right there — "no status files — query
// live state".
//
// So the answer is one read of the binding, taken once per process, and it is
// deliberately allowed to be wrong in exactly one direction: reporting clean
// when the read failed would retire the probe over beads that are still there,
// so a failed read answers "relics".
//
// The verdict counts every resident, open or closed. Closing a relic does not
// make it unreachable — it is still shown, reopened, claimed and written by id,
// and `gc storage migrate` never deletes the work store's pre-migration copy —
// so a rule that retired the probe when the last relic CLOSED would send that
// id back to a frozen copy that reads OPEN forever (ga-qdt5y.19). Because
// nothing ever deletes a relic, the widened verdict is MONOTONE: a binding that
// has ever held a resident holds one for good. Staleness can therefore only
// keep a probe alive, never retire one, which is what makes reading it once per
// process sound rather than merely cheap.
//
// The once-per-process part rests on one premise: no relic ARRIVES while the
// process runs. That holds because the only thing that creates one is `gc
// storage migrate`, which refuses to run against a city with a live controller
// (cmd/gc/infra_class_migrate.go, guarded by
// TestEnsureInfraClassMigratedRefusesWhileAnotherControllerIsLive). If that
// refusal is ever relaxed, this verdict has to be recomputed on migrate rather
// than taken once at boot.
