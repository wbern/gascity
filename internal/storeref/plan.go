// The plan: which stores answer this question, in what order, and what a
// per-leg failure means.
//
// A ResolvedPlan is DATA. It performs no I/O and it prints as the row format
// the conformance corpus pins. That is what lets a migration slice assert "the
// store list this site builds today == the resolver's plan" before it swaps in
// the executor, and what makes a leg-order change a diff in a golden table
// rather than a paragraph in a review.
//
// It is NOT comparable — it carries a leg slice, so `==` on two plans does not
// compile. Compare them the way the corpus does, through String(); comparing
// their leg SETS is refSet's job in the tests, and it exists precisely because
// the two comparisons have to fail differently.
