// Building bindings from opened routes, once.
//
// Three planes group a city's relocated classes by the store serving them — the
// CLI's storageRoutes, the API's State accessors, and the controller they share
// — and each then has to turn that grouping into ClassBindings. The turning is
// where the residence-probe retirement condition is decided, and it was written
// out twice: two derivations of the same question, in packages that never
// import each other, either of which could be edited alone.
//
// A disagreement there is silent in the worst direction. The two halves of the
// condition (ClassBinding.MintsReserved, ClassBinding.HasLegacyResidents) are
// pessimistic by construction, so a copy that drifted OPTIMISTIC would not fail
// a build or a read: it would retire the probe on one plane and keep it on the
// other, and the plane that retired it would answer "no such bead" for every id
// the split preserved. Sharing the body is what makes the pessimism a property
// of the program rather than of two files agreeing today.

	// the census anyway (cmd/gc/by_id_relic_proof.go argues that at length). A
