// The HTTP plane's half of the ADR-0009 work-record close gate.
//
// internal/workrecord owns the contract — which beads it covers, what a valid
// record is, whether enforcement is on — and cmd/gc has run it on the CLI plane
// since the contract shipped. This file is the other door. A bead closes through
// POST /bead/{id}/close and through a closed-status POST /bead/{id}/update, and
// an ungated door does not merely leak the odd close: it becomes the way closes
// get done, because the drain that cannot close through the gate closes through
// whatever still answers.
//
// Two things are this plane's own, and neither belongs in the shared package.
// The first is the CHECKOUT TABLE the repository rule reads — the city
// directory and the rig paths, which this plane holds in its live State and the
// CLI holds in the config the invocation loaded. Which repository a given bead
// answers to is not this plane's own: workrecord.RepoDirFor decides it from the
// bead's owner, so both doors judge one bead against one repository. The second
// is the refusal, which is the already-registered wrong-state 409 — the state
// being wrong is precisely that the bead is not closable yet — so gating these
// routes adds no status to the OpenAPI surface.

// workRecordCommitReachable answers the gate's reachability clause. It is a

// gateWorkRecordClose checks a bead the caller is about to close against the
// work-record contract, returning a 409 when enforcement is on and the record
// does not satisfy it (nil otherwise — warn-only is the default, so a violation
// is logged and the close proceeds).
//
// stored is the row the residency resolver read and store is the store that
// holds it. submitted carries the metadata of the same request, which the
// documented atomic close uses to stamp the record and close in one call:
// beads.UpdateOpts.Metadata is an additive merge, so validating only the stored
// row would refuse a request that supplies a perfectly good record. Coverage is
// decided on the stored row — both Type and gc.kind, read before any submitted
// field is applied — so a request cannot escape the gate by stamping gc.kind on
// its way out, nor by retyping a gated task away from task. The same choice
// means the reverse direction is NOT covered: a closing update that converts a
// non-gated bead into a task closes ungated, because the type it would be gated
// on is the one the request is about to write. That is the boundary the CLI door
// has at isWorkRecordGatedBead in cmd/gc/work_record_gate.go, which decides
// coverage on the stored row and then projects metadata only; moving it belongs
// in internal/workrecord so both doors move together rather than asking
// different questions of different populations.
//
// ctx is the request's, and it reaches the reachability clause because that
// clause shells out to git: a client that hangs up has to be able to stop the
// subprocess, or a wedged repository leaves one blocking call per retry.
//
// Known limit — the check and the write are not atomic. The row validated here
// is the one resolveBeadOwner read, and the caller applies its close or update
// afterwards without re-reading it, so a concurrent write landing in that window
// is neither seen by the gate nor refused by the write. A close that races an
// edit stripping gc.work_outcome can therefore pass a check the final row would
// have failed. The CLI door has the same shape at evaluateWorkRecordCloseGate in
// cmd/gc/work_record_gate.go, which validates a stored (or pre-fetched) bead and
// then lets the bd invocation write.
//
// The remedy is to fence the write on the revision the gate read —
// beads.ConditionalWriter already spells it (CloseIfMatch/UpdateIfMatch, via
// beads.ResolveConditionalWriter) — so this is a change to the close paths, not
// to the store contract. It is left for a follow-up because the fence has to be
// threaded through both doors together and only capable stores carry it: a store
// that resolves as legacy has no revision to fence on, so the gate would need a
// degraded path there rather than a refusal. The window is small and the losing
// outcome is a close that recorded slightly less than it should, not a corrupted
// row.

// predates the residency census, so their closes are unchanged.
//
// The store is matched by asking each CONFIGURED rig whether it is the one that
// answered, rather than by enumerating the loaded stores: an enumeration is a
// list of work stores, which is blind to a binding by construction, and the
// question is not "which stores exist" but "does the store that answered belong
// to a rig with a checkout".
//
// A store no configured rig claims is the city store or a class binding, and
// both answered to the city checkout before this rule existed. buildStores keys
// only from cfg.Rigs and swaps the config and the store map under one lock, so
// there is no third population to mistake for one.
//
// The converse population is real and this answer is a guess for it: in legacy
// shared-file mode buildStores aliases every rig backed by that store to one
// handle, so MANY rigs claim it and the identity match selects whichever is
// configured first — an ownerless bead whose work happened on a different rig
// is judged against that first rig's checkout. The loop predates this rule and
// RepoDirFor strictly narrows it, since a bead that names an owner no longer
// reaches here; what is left is the pre-census population, where no answer is
// better than a guess because the bead records nothing to resolve.
//
// Two shapes still produce "unknown" here: a configured rig that names no
// checkout, and a city with no path at all. Both are defensive against a State
// implementation the current ones do not produce — buildStores skips a rig with
// an empty path outright, so BeadStore answers nil for one and the identity
// match never selects it, and cityPath is set once at construction from an
