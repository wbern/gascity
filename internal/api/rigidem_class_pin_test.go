// createIdemRecord writes straight to the store it is handed — there is no
// placement hop on the path — and that is only correct while the record
// classifies as work, which today it does by falling through every arm of
// coordclass.Classify: "gc-idem" is not a class marker. The day coordclass
// grows an arm that claims it, the write becomes a stranded one: the record
// lands in the work ledger while the class's own readers look at the relocated
// binding, and the rig-create idempotency axis silently stops converging on a
// split city. The one thing that would notice is confirmInfraConvergence
// (cmd/gc/infra_class_migrate.go), which re-checks containment on every boot
// of a converged split city and refuses to serve while naming the stranded
// ids — but only after the writes are already stranded, and not at all on a
// city that converged before its copy manifest was recorded, where
// stranded-write detection is off. Failing at build time instead is why the
// hazard gets a pin rather than a seam.
//
// The pin's scope is createIdemRecord's create-time literal: the post-create
// SetMetadataBatch writers are trusted to stay within gc.idem.*, a namespace
