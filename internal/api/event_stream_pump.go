// projectWorkflowEventWithSlack computes an event's optional workflow
// projection only while the subscriber is keeping up (backlog == 0).
//
// Resolving a projection reads the bead stores: when the event payload does not
// identify the subject as a workflow bead, every store is probed, and a store
// Get that misses the cache falls through to the backing store — for a
// bd-backed rig, a subprocess. Computing that inline for every
// bead.created/updated/closed event made delivery hostage to bead-store
// latency: one slow store stalled the whole stream head-of-line, and a
// subscriber received a small fraction of the log wherever its cursor sat.
//
// Delivery is the stream's contract; the projection is enrichment. It is
// already absent whenever it cannot be resolved, and the endpoint documents
// it as optional, so dropping it while the stream is behind costs a consumer
// no guarantee it had. The event itself is still delivered in seq order with
// its payload bead, and projections resume on their own once the subscriber
// catches up.
//
// Note: requires_resync is NOT a general backstop here — projectWorkflowEvent
// sets it only for bead.updated (convoy_event_stream.go), and it is omitempty,
// so a dropped bead.created/bead.closed projection carries no resync flag.
