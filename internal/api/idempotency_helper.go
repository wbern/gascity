// withIdempotency runs create() at most once per (scoped key, request body),
// giving create endpoints safe retries via the Idempotency-Key header.
//
// The scoped key is "POST:<path>:<key>" — namespaced by path so the same
// Idempotency-Key value on two different endpoints within one city can't
// collide. Every city-scoped caller passes a static endpoint path (e.g.
// "/v0/agents"), so this scoping is intra-city only; cross-city isolation does
// NOT come from the key. It comes from each city owning a separate *Server,
// and therefore a separate idem cache, built per city by getCityServer via
// New(state). A future refactor that hoisted a per-city cache to a
// process-wide scope would silently reintroduce cross-city key collisions
// despite this scoping. On a repeat with a completed reservation it replays
// the cached typed body value; an in-flight repeat returns
// apierr.IdempotencyInFlight (409); a same-key/different-body repeat returns
// apierr.IdempotencyMismatch (422).
//
// It ALWAYS releases the pending reservation when create() returns an error OR
// panics (via defer), so no caller can leak a reservation — the defect the
// hand-rolled per-handler unreserve boilerplate was prone to. When key == "" it
// is a passthrough: create() runs exactly once and nothing is cached.
//
// create() should perform all fallible work (validation, the store write) and
// return the domain body value to cache. Callers wrap that value in their
// response envelope after withIdempotency returns, so envelope fields derived
// from live state (e.g. the X-GC-Index event sequence) stay fresh on replay.
//
// idem is the owning cache: per-city handlers pass s.idem (the per-city cache
// described above); supervisor-scope handlers (POST /v0/city, where no per-city
// Server exists yet) pass sm.idem, the SupervisorMux's own process-wide cache.
