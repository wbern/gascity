// Where a created bead goes.
//
// Every other residency seam on this plane answers "where does this bead
// LIVE" — a probe with an id in hand and a store that either holds it or does
// not. Create is the one question the topology alone can answer and no probe
// can: the bead does not exist yet, so there is nothing to look for, and the
// only thing that decides the store is the class the body describes.
//
// That is why this file executes a ModeSingleOwner plan rather than reusing
// resolveBeadOwner. A placement plan names the owner; a by-id plan names a
// probe ORDER whose leading leg is not a placement.

// createStoreForBead picks the store a POST /v0/beads body is created in.
//
// The rule has two halves and the second is what keeps this change safe. On a
// city with no class binding — the shipped default — the answer is exactly
// findStore(rig), byte for byte, and the resolver is never consulted: a
// placement plan over a topology whose work leg is nil has no leg at all, and
// turning today's "rig is required" into a planning error would break a working
// create. On a converged city an infrastructure-class body is placed at the
// binding, because the work ledger it would otherwise land in is the store the
// city moved that class off; a bead minted there carries the work ledger's id
// prefix and cannot be relocated afterwards by copying it.
//
// An infrastructure class combined with an explicit rig is refused rather than
// resolved. A binding is city-keyed — there is one per city and no per-rig
// binding to route to — so the request names something that does not exist, and
// both silent answers are lies: honoring the rig re-creates the stranded write,
// ignoring it returns a bead that is not where the caller was told to look.
//
// Placement is by CLASS and by rig, and b.ParentID is deliberately not
// consulted. Following it would be the intuitive rule and the wrong one: a
// graph-class step whose parent is a work bead in a rig ledger would be minted
// under the rig's prefix, in the store the city moved the graph class off, and
// no later copy can change an id. ParentID stays a weak city-scoped reference
// (see beads.Bead.ParentID) precisely so a cross-store parent is a normal
// shape here rather than a placement input.
