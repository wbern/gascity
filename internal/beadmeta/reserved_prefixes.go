// redelivering the same nudge is idempotent without a lookup. Those records

// matters to routing; they are simply not minted by the store's own sequence,

// it. The queue in internal/storebinding mints ids with it; the reserved-prefix
// table above routes ids carrying it to the nudges binding. A copy in each
// package would let one change alone, and that split is silent in the worst
// way: the minter writes ids under a prefix the router no longer reserves, so
// queue records land in the work ledger, the queue reads its own binding, finds
// nothing, and stops draining without an error anywhere.

// the segment before the first "-", so carrying the dash here would make the
