// drainResidency is the frame a drain resolves ids over: the routed work class
// store, plus the drain's own ambient store as the one class binding.
//
// It is built here rather than threaded down from the city on purpose — a city
// topology federates every serving rig, and handing that to a drain would let a
// drain resolve a member out of another scope. The two stores the caller
// already routed are the whole frame.
//
// The zero BindingOptions leaves Relics nil, which BuildBinding reads as "may
// hold legacy residents" and so keeps the residence probe. That is the honest
// answer for a caller that took no census.
