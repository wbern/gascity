// This file implements GetLastActivity for herdr. herdr exposes no activity
// timestamp anywhere in its API, so the provider maintains one: a lazily
// started tracker polls agent.list and stamps a per-session last-activity
// time from what the polls OBSERVE. The design constraints, in order:
//
//   - Level-triggered only. herdr replays a backlog of recent events to every
//     new subscription (see events.go), so event content is never a stamp
//     source — a replayed "went idle" frame minutes after the fact would
//     refresh activity that didn't happen. Polls are the sole source of
//     truth; the session-event stream merely accelerates the next poll.
//   - working is continuously active. A status that SITS at working emits no
//     transitions. Stamping only transitions would make long legitimate work
//     look stale, and the progress-stall / idle-timeout nets would recycle a
//     live agent — the churn class that got the #312 idle nudger reverted
//     (#468). While the last polled status is working, GetLastActivity
//     returns now.
//   - Status outranks the revision counter. agent.list carries a per-pane
//     output revision, but a DETECTED agent's idle TUI may still redraw
//     (spinners, status lines), and stamping those ticks would make idle
//     sessions read as permanently active. The revision stamps activity only
//     for sessions herdr cannot classify (agent_status "unknown", e.g. bare
//     shells), where it is the only signal there is. Caveat, verified live:
//     herdr 0.7.3 moves the revision only while a client renders the pane —
//     on a headless server (gc's normal mode) it holds at 0, so this leg
//     contributes exactly when someone is attached and degrades to
//     first-observation + status-change stamping otherwise.
//   - Outages keep the last state. A failed poll must not fabricate idleness
//     or absence: wiping a working entry during a socket blip would hand a
//     config-drift reset or stall recycle a live agent to kill. Entries
//     change only when a poll SUCCEEDS.
//
// The tracker starts on the first GetLastActivity call — synchronously, so
// even that first answer reflects real state rather than a cold zero — and
// then lives as long as the provider. There is no teardown hook in the
// runtime.Provider surface; a provider swapped out by a config reload leaks
// one tracker until process exit, which is accepted and bounded (reload with
// a provider change is rare, and the tracker is one goroutine plus one
// subscription). Stamps are process-local: after a controller restart the
// idle clocks restart from first observation, so idle-driven actions fire at
// most one timeout period late — never early.

// Poll/debounce knobs. Vars so tests can shrink them; production values:
//   - activityPollInterval: reconcile cadence when no events arrive. 30s
//     matches the event stream's op bound and keeps steady-state load at two
//     cheap socket calls a minute.
//   - activityEventDebounce: coalesces an event burst into one poll, same
//     value as the stream's relist debounce.
//   - activityPollTimeout: bound on one agent.list call so a wedged server
//     cannot hang the seed call or the loop.
//   - activitySeedRetryInterval / activitySeedRetryBudget: herdr's own
//     agent-detection can lag pane creation by a poll or two, so the seed
//     poll retries at this cadence until the requested session appears or
//     the budget elapses, rather than trusting a single one-shot query.
