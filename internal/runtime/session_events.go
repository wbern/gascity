// session events to every new subscription, and frames carry nothing that
// would let the stream filter the replay). A consumer reacts to an event by
// checking the session's live state, never by applying the event's content
// as the current truth.

	// with no agent mapping); consumers should treat unattributed lifecycle
	// events as a hint to reconcile broadly rather than ignore them.

// SessionEventProvider is an optional extension for providers with a native
// push event stream. It lets consumers react to session death and agent
// activity in real time instead of polling; providers without one (tmux) are
// simply not asserted to it and stay on the polled paths.
//
// Contract:
//   - The stream self-heals: on transport failure it reconnects with backoff
//     until ctx is canceled. Subscribing does not require the provider's
//     server to be up yet; the stream attaches when it appears.
//   - Every connection cycle begins with a SessionEventResync event, and a
//     resync is also emitted after any in-stream loss. Consumers must treat
//     resync as "poll now": events between cycles may be lost. Events right
//     after a resync may also be a replayed backlog of things that happened
//     before it (see SessionEvent) — level-triggered consumption absorbs
//     both.
//   - Under consumer backpressure the provider may drop events, coalescing
//     the loss into a later SessionEventResync — never a silent gap.
//   - Canceling ctx ends the stream and closes the channel.
