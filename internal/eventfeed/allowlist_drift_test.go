// imports internal/events) while staying in lockstep with the canonical event
// constants. If the supervisor renames/removes a constant's value or the pkg
// literal is mistyped, this fails CI. It queries the published API
// (IsAllowed/AllowedTypeList) since the allowlist map is unexported.

// question "should this new event leave the machine?" is the one an export
// allowlist exists to force someone to answer. Stating it here makes a later
// addition a deliberate edit to a test that explains the reasoning, rather than
// a silent widening of what gc ships off-box.
//
// Both are operational telemetry about a worker's own process lifecycle —
// invocation ages, parent liveness, claims given back — with no cross-machine
// consumer. execution.step_stalled (deploy lanes only) is the same shape and is
// denied for the same reason. If a hosted consumer ever needs them, add them to
// the allowlist AND to the want list above, and delete the entry here.
