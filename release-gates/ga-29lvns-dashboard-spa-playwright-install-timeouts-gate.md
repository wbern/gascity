| # | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Review PASS present | PASS | `ga-luwbo3` records `verdict: pass` for the exact reviewed commit `dbffcbe02523f13b3a3bdcf7fe31bc0bd7ecedc0`; no review carryover was used. |
| 2 | Acceptance criteria met | PASS | The Playwright install step writes apt HTTP timeout `15` before its three-attempt loop, bounds each `npm run test:e2e:install:ci` invocation with `timeout 240`, retains the 12-minute outer step timeout, and preserves backoff/final failure. The diff-owned policy test and an induced-stall control-flow simulation pass. |
| 3 | Tests pass | PASS | Local full-suite, policy, build, vet, actionlint, and diff-owned evidence pass after attribution. The changed Dashboard SPA job's first real PR execution also completed successfully; see the linked run below. |
| 4 | No unresolved HIGH review findings | PASS | Reviewer reported no blockers, majors, or minors; unresolved HIGH count is 0. |
| 5 | Final branch clean | PASS | The reviewed tree is clean; `git diff --check` and changed-file formatting/lint pass; `.githooks` is configured as `core.hooksPath`. |
| 6 | Branch diverges cleanly from main | PASS | After a fresh fetch, `git merge-tree --write-tree origin/main dbffcbe02523f13b3a3bdcf7fe31bc0bd7ecedc0` exited 0 and produced tree `908d61961c0ee8af186dbaefa4092da14ded224b`; no self-rebase was needed. |
| 7 | Single feature theme | PASS | The three-file diff is one CI-hardening theme: workflow time bounds plus the policy implementation and regression test that enforce them. |

## Criterion 2: acceptance evidence

- Exact workflow literals and ordering are enforced by `TestPlaywrightChromiumInstallHardensAgainstHungAptMirror`: apt `Acquire::http::Timeout "15"` is configured before the retry loop, each attempt uses `timeout 240 npm run test:e2e:install:ci`, and the step retains `timeout-minutes: 12`.
- The existing three-attempt loop, linear 10/20-second backoff, success exit, and final failure exit are unchanged.
- Induced-stall simulation used a one-second stand-in timeout around a ten-second sleeper and observed attempts 1, 2, and 3 before final failure (`simulation_result=PASS attempts=3 elapsed_seconds=3`). This verifies that a timed-out command advances through the retry loop; the policy test separately locks the production timeout values.
- `actionlint .github/workflows/ci.yml`: PASS.
- `make test-ci-policy`: PASS.

## Criterion 3: local test evidence

`test_cmd: make test-local-full-parallel`

`test_cmd_scope: full-suite`

Environment: rootless Podman 5.8.4 via `DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/user/1000/podman/podman.sock`; `TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_DISABLED=true`. The repository has no Go testcontainers reference or pinned testcontainer image, and this diff adds no container-backed test.

- Raw result: all 40 job logs completed; 29 job-level PASS and 11 job-level FAIL.
- Top-level counts across preserved verbose logs: 46,467 PASS, 12 FAIL, 210 SKIP.
- `diff_tests_executed`: `TestPlaywrightChromiumInstallHardensAgainstHungAptMirror` PASS in `unit-core` and PASS again in `integration-packages-core-4-of-4`; 0 diff-owned FAIL and 0 diff-owned SKIP.
- Skip justification: the 210 skips are suite-declared platform, optional-provider, live-infrastructure, helper-process, or opt-in persistence exclusions. None is diff-owned.
- Build/static evidence: `go build ./...` PASS; `go vet ./...` PASS; `make fmt-check-changed` PASS; `make lint-changed` PASS for `./scripts/cipolicy`; `git diff --check` PASS; `actionlint .github/workflows/ci.yml` PASS.
- `policy_lane: make test-ci-policy — PASS`. This is the policy target invoked by `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; the repository has no `ci-pr-policy` target.
- `waiver_ref: none` — failures below are attributed under the non-diff-owned failure protocol, not waived.

### Failure attribution

Every tracker predates this run, each current sighting was appended and read back, no failing test file overlaps the diff, and `go list -deps -test` confirms the failing `cmd/gc`, `internal/runtime/acp`, `internal/runtime/tmux`, and integration packages do not import `scripts/cipolicy`.

- `TestFreshManagedBdCityInitSeedsPinnedHQDatabaseAndKeepsGCPrefix`, `TestAdoptPRFormulaCompileAndRun`, `TestPersonalWorkFormulaCompileAndRun`, `TestAdoptPRFormulaRetriesTransientReviewerStep`, `TestAdoptPRFormulaSoftFailsGeminiAfterTransientRetries`, `TestRetryManagedPooledWorkerRecoversClaimedAttemptAfterCrash`, `TestHumaBinary_CityCreateAsync`, and `TestGCLiveContract_BeadsAndEvents` -> `ga-esyijp`. Proof: each failed during fixture bootstrap on the exact shared-server pending-schema-migration refusal before scenario behavior ran. The workflow/policy diff cannot affect Dolt schema migration or `bd init`.
- `TestE2E_SuspendResume_City` -> `ga-dc9utn`. Proof: exact 93.83-second missing `citysus.report` signature; the tracker documents the independently proven reconciler suspend/wake defect and its fix bead. This diff cannot reach that path.
- `TestIsAgentRunning` -> `ga-vzckwr`. Proof: exact tracked transient setup-shell signature (`current cmd: zsh`, `setup cmd: sh`) in both matching-shell subtests. The open fix bead predates this run; the diff does not touch or reach tmux runtime code.
- `TestStartSeedsDurableActivity` and `TestDoltStateWaitReadyCmdReturnsReady` -> `ga-vkhfnj`. Proof: both exhausted fixed readiness deadlines under the same 40-job shared-host contention run (5-second ACP initialize and one-second fake-Dolt readiness respectively). Their packages cannot import the only changed Go package and their test paths do not overlap the diff.

The diff adds one ordinary policy test function, not a new suite target and not a resource-census bump. All attributions use affirmative mechanism or import-coverage proof, so the inconclusive added-load guard does not apply.

### CI-config lane evidence

`ci_lane_run: https://github.com/gastownhall/gascity/actions/runs/34691635307/job/103547835124 — PASS`

The diff modifies `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, specifically the real Dashboard SPA job. Draft PR #6305 supplied the required first real execution on CI run `34691635307` at head `755e45653747019231ece91d2fd36998b05554b1`. Job `103547835124` ran from `2026-09-12T11:40:21Z` through `2026-09-12T11:41:53Z` and concluded `success`; every step passed, including `Install Playwright Chromium` and `Playwright render smoke (Layer B)`.
