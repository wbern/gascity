#
# The eleventh blind reader must be unwritable.
#
# The typed-store split shipped a PLACEMENT contract (one authoritative accessor
# per class for "which store OWNS creates of class C"). It never shipped a
# LOOKUP contract, and "which stores answer this question, in what order, with
# what failure semantics" was hand-rolled at ~90 call sites built from two
# binding-blind base enumerators. internal/storeref's residency resolver is now
# that contract; this guard is what stops a ninety-first site from being
# written.
#
# WHAT IT SCANS: non-test .go under cmd/gc, internal/api, internal/sling and
# internal/dispatch, for the store-enumeration vocabulary declared in
# scripts/residency-boundary-patterns.txt — four families:
#
#   (a) base-enumerator consumption — BeadStores(), rigBeadStores(),
#       coordClassStoreCandidates(, workAssignmentStores(,
#       openAllConvoyStoresAt(, openConvoyStores(, openSourceWorkflowStores(,
#       convoyStoreCandidates(. None of these ever contains a class binding, so
#       every list built from one is binding-blind by construction.
#   (b) direct binding-gate re-derivation — graphClassBinding(,
#       routes.storeFor(, storeref.ClassCandidates(. Asking "is this class
#       relocated" a second time is how the split-store bug class reproduces
#       (#5125, #5127).
#   (c) hand-rolled probe lists and plan disassembly — a []beads.Store{ literal,
#       and reaching a PlanLeg's .Leg.Store directly. The executor
#       (ResolveOwner/Union) is the only place leg order and per-leg error policy
#       are applied; a literal list skips both, and so does a consumer that runs
#       a plan's legs itself. Both shapes have baselined hits, so growth is the
#       violation; the .Leg.Store row also has an AST twin that sees the same
#       access split across a line break or wrapped in a parenthesis.
#       WorkLegsForID is the same idea one level up: a plane that implements
#       storeref.WorkAxisRouter tells the resolver to use the plane's leg order
#       instead of its own, so a second implementation is a second answer to the
#       same question. The rule governing that — one axis per plane, and a
#       cross-plane agreement pin the day a second appears — is stated in
#       scripts/residency-boundary-patterns.txt beside the row.
#   (d) bespoke residence probes — IDInNamespace(, bdIDIsClassReserved(,
#       ReservedClassPrefix(. The namespace gate is the resolver's, and a site
#       that re-derives it is one `gc storage migrate` away from ga-axin6.
#
# THE RATCHET: scripts/residency-boundary-baseline.txt pins today's census as
# `path <TAB> enclosing function <TAB> pattern <TAB> count`. The check fails on any hit ABOVE the pinned
# count (a new blind reader, unwritable from day one) and on any pinned count
# the tree no longer reaches (the baseline must SHRINK in the same commit that
# retires a site). Shrink-only, like the resource-census ratchet.
#
# WHY COUNTS-PER-FUNCTION AND NOT LINE NUMBERS: a file:line baseline fails on
# every edit ABOVE a pinned line, which turns the guard into a false-positive
# generator for unrelated work and trains reviewers to rubber-stamp the marker.
# Counts are immune to line drift and still forbid growth. Keyed by file ALONE
# they were also maskable — a new site paired with a removal in the same file
# kept the count level, and since family (a) is consumption-shaped the
# signature-level AST half could not see it either. The enclosing function is
# therefore part of the key.
#
# THE HONEST RESIDUAL: a swap WITHIN one function of one pattern — deleting one
# `BeadStores()` call and adding another in the same function — still keeps the
# count level. That is a much smaller hole than the file-level one, it is
# visible in the diff of a single function, and the AST half additionally
# catches any new store-list SIGNATURE, which is the shape a genuinely new
# resolver-bypassing helper takes.
#
# WHAT THIS HALF CANNOT SEE AT ALL: four rules live only in the Go half
# (scripts/residency_signature_rule_test.go and
# scripts/residency_expression_rules_test.go), because each needs a parse tree
# to separate a reference from a declaration or from prose —
#   ast:returns-store-list        a new store-list signature, including one
#                                 spelled as a local type name or hung off a
#                                 package var as a func value
#   ast:vocabulary-alias          taking a guarded accessor as a VALUE instead
#                                 of calling it
#   ast:plan-leg-store-chain      `.Leg.Store` reached across a line break or
#                                 through a parenthesis
#   ast:uncounted-call-spelling   a call whose dot, name and `(` are not on one
#                                 line, or whose package qualifier was renamed
#                                 at the import — both invisible to every
#                                 call-shaped row in the pattern file
# They ratchet against the SAME baseline file, keyed the same way; this script's
# --emit-baseline prints only its own rows, which is why regenerating needs all
# three emitters listed at the top of that baseline.
#
# SELF-TEST: `--self-test` proves the guard's own bite on real temp trees (new
# site fails, marker suppresses, stale baseline fails, fail-closed cases fail).
# `make check-residency-boundary` runs it before the real check.
#
# ESCAPE HATCH: a trailing `// residency:allow <reason>` on the line, same
# discipline as `// boundary:allow`. Regenerating the baseline to absorb a new
# hit defeats the ratchet: the diff is the review.
#
# FAILS CLOSED: a missing scan directory, an unreadable baseline, or a census
# that finds nothing at all is a violation, not a pass. A guard that silently
# passes when it cannot evaluate manufactures false confidence.

# EXEMPTION IS SCOPED TO THE CALL SITE, NOT THE FILE. This list holds one entry,
# and the four it used to hold are now ordinary baseline rows.
#
# The allowlist filters a file BEFORE counting, so nothing inside an exempt file
# is censused — including a helper that hands the derivation back OUT. A
# one-line `func launder() map[string]beads.Store { return BeadStores() }` in an
# exempt file re-exports the enumeration to callers anywhere in the tree: the
# body is never counted, `launder` is not vocabulary, and both halves pass. The
# AST half shares the hole, since it skips the same files and so cannot see the
# store-list result type either.
#
# residency_topology.go, internal/api/residency_topology.go, infra_class_migrate.go
# and cmd_storage.go genuinely do have to enumerate — they are the constructors
# that BUILD topology and the tools that migrate it — so the hits they turn out
# to hold between them are pinned in the shrink-only baseline instead: six, one
# per row (internal/api/residency_topology.go holds none, and now has to keep
# holding none). That exempts the calls that exist rather than the files around
# them, and a seventh is a reviewed baseline change like anywhere else.
#
# One of those six is the guarded accessor's OWN `func` line. The census sets
# the enclosing function from a line and then tests that same line, so a
# declaration of vocabulary counts as a mention of it. That is not a defect to
# net out: the row still moves if the declaration is deleted or renamed, which
# is the movement worth seeing. It does mean "hits" here is mentions, not call
# sites — the five real call sites are the smaller number.
#
# The alias evasion this leaves — taking the accessor as a VALUE rather than
# calling it, which no value-position grep row can catch without also firing on
# every mention in a comment — is closed on the AST side, by the
# ast:vocabulary-alias rule in scripts/residency_expression_rules_test.go.

#                        have no baseline row to be pinned by, and dropping the

# census prints `path <TAB> function <TAB> pattern <TAB> count`, sorted.
#
# WHY THE FUNCTION IS PART OF THE KEY: a count keyed by file alone masks a
# consumption site that is PAIRED with a removal — delete one rigBeadStores()
# call in city_runtime.go, add a different one in another function of the same
# file, and the count is level. Family (a) is the bulk of this baseline and is
# consumption-shaped, so the signature-level AST half cannot see that swap
# either. Keying by enclosing function shrinks the hole to a swap WITHIN one
# function, which is the honest residual and is small enough that the diff shows
# it.
#
# ENCLOSING FUNCTION is read the way gofmt guarantees it can be: a top-level
# declaration starts at column 0, and only a top-level body closes with a `}` at
# column 0, so a state machine over those two lines attributes every line to its
# top-level function (a closure's hits belong to the function containing it) or
# to (file-scope). `make fmt-check` is what keeps that guarantee true. The Go
# half runs the identical rule, so the two halves key the same way by
# construction.
#
# A comment line, and a line bearing the `// residency:allow` marker, is not a
# site. One awk pass over every scanned file rather than one grep per (file,
# pattern): the guard runs on every commit, and a quadratic scan is a guard
# people disable.
#
# THE UNION PREFILTER is what keeps that true. `$0 ~ pregex[i]` is a DYNAMIC
# regex — the pattern is a variable, so gawk compiles it per evaluation and its
# small cache thrashes when 25 of them rotate. At ~300k lines that is 7.4M
# compiles and the census took four minutes of pinned CPU, which is exactly the
# quadratic-scan failure this comment warned about arriving by another route.
# Testing one combined alternation first means the same variable is compiled on
# nearly every line (cache hit) and the 25-way loop runs only on the ~0.03% of
# lines that can match. The union is the alternation of the same rows, so the
# output is identical by construction — and the baseline is a byte-level golden
# that proves it: any change in what the loop reports fails the ratchet.
#
# node_modules and the dashboard bundle are pruned here and in the Go half. They
# are not Go source we own — internal/api/dashboardspa's vendored tree holds
# exactly one .go file, some upstream package's test fixture — and censusing it
# would let a dependency bump move this repo's baseline.
