// The residency lookup contract's CI-visible enforcement: the scaffolding its
// rules share.
//
// The contract has two halves and one baseline. The GREP half counts the
// store-enumeration vocabulary declared in residency-boundary-patterns.txt; the
// AST half sees what grep cannot — a function SIGNATURE that hands a caller a
// raw store list, whatever its body called to build it, and the expression
// spellings that fetch the vocabulary without calling it. Every rule ratchets
// against scripts/residency-boundary-baseline.txt, so no two can disagree about
// what is pinned.
//
//	residency_boundary_test.go          this file: scan scope, the allowlist,
//	                                    the pattern names, the shared walk, and
//	                                    the signature rule's type helpers
//	residency_grep_rule_test.go         rules a-d, the vocabulary census

//
// scripts/check-residency-boundary.sh is the shell rendering of the grep half:
// it reads the SAME pattern file, is wired into `make check`, and proves its own
// bite through `--self-test`. This package is the rendering that runs in CI,
// since ./scripts is inside UNIT_COVER_PKGS_NONCMDGC (the route
// check_split_topology_rows_test.go established) — and it deliberately spawns no
// subprocess, because the test-resource census ratchets untagged subprocess call
// sites and a guard is not worth a debt row.
//
// Every control across these files is falsified with a REAL on-disk edit in a
// t.TempDir() tree, never an overlay: the guard reads files, and an in-memory
// overlay cannot prove a file-reading guard bites.

// residencyAllowlist mirrors the shell guard's. It holds ONE file, and the

// allowlist filters a file BEFORE counting, so a helper written inside an
// exempt file can re-export the derivation to callers anywhere in the tree and
// no half of this guard ever sees it — the wrapper's body is not censused and
// the wrapper's own name is not vocabulary. The topology constructors and the
// migration tooling do have to enumerate; they are pinned as ordinary
// shrink-only baseline rows instead, which is exemption scoped to the CALL
// SITE rather than to the file around it.
//
// cmd_bd_topology.go stays exempt because it does not exist here: it is the
// fork-only work-axis router, overlaid downstream and orthogonal to class
// residency. It can have no upstream baseline row, so a baseline pin is not
// available to it and dropping the exemption would break the fork the day it

// The walk RECURSES, because the grep half does (`find "${present[@]}" -type f
// -name '*.go'`). A flat read left every subpackage of a governed directory —
// internal/api/dashboardbff, internal/api/genclient — outside this half
// entirely: a store-list constructor added there was caught only if its body
// also spelled the grep half's vocabulary, which a hand-rolled probe list need
// not do. The halves are supposed to cover the same tree by different means,
// not different trees.
//
// It returns the ALLOWLISTED files too, and leaves the filtering to each rule.
// The allowlist exempts a file from being COUNTED; the signature rule still has
// to read one for the type declarations a package's aliases come from, and a
// walk that dropped it here would make an exempt file the one place to mint an
// invisible spelling for the rest of its package.
//
// The result is deliberately NOT memoized across calls. The controls falsify
// each rule by rewriting real files in a t.TempDir() tree and rescanning, so a
// cache keyed by root would hand a control the tree from before its own edit
// and report that the guard bit when it had not been asked. One walk per scan
// is the honest shape, and it is what this delivers: one walk-and-prune
// IMPLEMENTATION shared by both AST rules, each of which still calls it once
// per scan. Removing the duplicated prune logic was worth more than the
