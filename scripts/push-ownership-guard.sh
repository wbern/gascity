# push-ownership-guard.sh — re-checks bd bead ownership/staleness
# immediately before an in-flight `git push` executes (bead ga-fip9ps.1;
# guards the race described in ga-fip9ps).
#
# THE RACE: an agent claims a bead, does work, and queues a push. A mayor
# stand-down/deconfliction ruling (reassign, reroute, close, hold) can land
# in the gap between "work finished" and "push actually executes" — e.g. a
# backgrounded push that was already queued before the ruling arrived. A
# stale push in that gap can clobber a branch another agent has since taken
# over (this happened on PR #4243, clobbering ga-lrqmb7's base). This guard
# closes that gap by re-reading bd's live state at the last possible moment
# before the push leaves the machine.
#
# THE EXPORTED FUNCTION: assert_bead_still_claimed. Re-resolves which bead
# this push is for (branch name, falling back to this session's in-progress
# assignment), re-reads its live state from bd, and returns non-zero
# (blocking the push) unless the bead is still open/in_progress, still
# assigned to one of this session's identities (any of GC_SESSION_NAME,
# GC_SESSION_ID, GC_ALIAS, GC_AGENT — mirroring the claim path), still
# routed to this session's config identity, and not held by the mayor or an
# external actor.
#
# TWO CALL SITES (defense in depth — see ga-fip9ps.1 bead notes):
#   Layer A — .githooks/pre-push calls this unconditionally for every
#             non-deletion push, independent of what changed. Escape hatch:
#             `git push --no-verify` (git-native, skips this hook entirely).
#   Layer B — scripts/rebase-resolve-lib.sh's attempt_bounded_self_rebase
#             calls this as the last check before its own
#             --force-with-lease push, in case that push executes in a
#             context where Layer A's hook isn't wired up (e.g. a clone
#             without core.hooksPath configured).
#
# FAIL CLOSED: any ambiguity (bd unreachable, the read times out, the
# response doesn't parse) blocks the push. The only sanctioned bypass is
# `git push --no-verify` for Layer A; Layer B has no bypass by design — an
# automated force-push is exactly the case this guard exists to stop.
# EXCEPTION (deploy/*-gate branches): these deliberately ignore the
# branch-embedded id and resolve solely via the assignee fallback (see
# _pog_resolve_bead_id). A *failed* assignee read is still ambiguity and
# still blocks; but a read that succeeds and finds no in-progress
# assignment leaves nothing to check, and the push is allowed — the same
# "no session, nothing to check" semantics every unmatched branch already
# has.
#
# This file ONLY defines functions and one default-value assignment;
# sourcing it must not produce output or otherwise mutate state.
#
# Set POG_DISABLE=1 to short-circuit assert_bead_still_claimed to a bare
# `return 0`. This exists for test harnesses that call
# attempt_bounded_self_rebase directly against synthetic repos with no real
# bead behind them (e.g. scripts/test-rebase-resolve.sh) and must stay
# hermetic — it is not meant to be set on a real push path.
#
# bd/Dolt reads below are wrapped by _pog_read_with_retry: a transient
# failure (lock contention, a slow response) is retried up to
# POG_READ_ATTEMPTS times, each attempt bounded by POG_TIMEOUT_SECONDS, with
# a short sleep between attempts. Only once every attempt fails does the
# guard block — this does not weaken fail-closed semantics (a persistently
# unreachable bd still blocks) and does not mask a genuine ownership change
# (a real answer, allow or block, is accepted on its first attempt; only a
# failed/empty read is retried). Override POG_READ_ATTEMPTS for test
# harnesses that want to exercise a specific attempt count without eating
# the real sleep/timeout cost of the production default.

# _pog_resolve_bead_id: prints the bead id this push should be checked
# against; prints nothing if none can be resolved. Resolution order:
#   1. The current branch name, matched against ga-[0-9a-z]{6}(\.[0-9]+)* —
#      the bead's own id format, extended with zero or more repeated
#      sub-bead suffixes because this repo's real branch convention is
#      builder/<bead-id>-<slug> and sub-beads are routine at any nesting
#      depth: a single-level sub-bead (e.g. ga-fip9ps.1) as well as a
#      grandchild (e.g. ga-o3ko1j.4.3). The suffix group must repeat (`*`),
#      not just appear once (`?`) — a single optional group truncates a
#      grandchild id after its first dotted segment, misresolving to the
#      wrong (and possibly closed) parent/child bead instead of the actual
#      grandchild bead the branch is for. The literal 6-char-only pattern
#      would misresolve to the root bead on any sub-bead's own branch.
#   2. Falls back to this session's single in-progress assignment
#      (bd list --assignee="$GC_AGENT" --status=in_progress --json) when
#      the branch name doesn't match.
# If both resolve and disagree, the branch match wins (it's the more
# specific signal) and a warning goes to stderr — this is a best-effort
# cross-check, not a hard failure, since branch-naming habits can
# legitimately drift from bd's bookkeeping. EXCEPTION: deploy/*-gate
# branches (see below) embed the id of the bead being gated, not the bead
# this push is for, so for that branch shape the live assignee wins instead.
#
# KNOWN LIMITATION of path 2 (confirmed by manual repro, not yet filed as
# its own bead): the fallback query itself filters on --status=in_progress,
# so it cannot find a bead that has already left in_progress (e.g. closed
# by the exact mayor ruling this guard exists to catch) by the time the
# fallback runs. In that narrow intersection — branch name doesn't encode
# the bead id AND the status flip lands before this resolves — no id
# resolves at all, and assert_bead_still_claimed's "nothing to check"
# branch below allows the push. This does NOT affect path 1: this repo's
# real branch convention (builder/<bead-id>-<slug>) always encodes the
# bead id, so the primary path is unaffected by a bead's status changing
# out from under it — with one deliberate exception: deploy/*-gate branches
# now route through path 2 by design (their branch-embedded id is the gated
# bead, not this push's bead), so that branch shape inherits this gap.
# Confirmed via manual repro, see
# test_fallback_cannot_detect_staleness_after_status_leaves_in_progress in
# scripts/test-push-ownership-guard.sh. The fallback query shape matches
# ga-fip9ps.1's own spec verbatim; widening it (e.g. dropping the status
# filter) trades this gap for ambiguous multi-match resolution against an
# agent's whole bead history, which is a real design decision for whoever
# owns that tradeoff, not a mechanical fix — left for a follow-up bead.
# Prints nothing (not an error) when neither resolves — the caller treats
# that as "nothing to check," which is what lets Layer A wire this in
# unconditionally without blocking every push in the repo.
