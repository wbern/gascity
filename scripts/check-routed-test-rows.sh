# Drift-prevention lint for the read-path six-row matrix defined by the
# enabler bead ga-71l (parent ga-h6w):
#
#     api-happy-path       — API path, 2xx, exit 0, route=api
#     api-cache-not-live   — API 503 "cache_not_live:", fallback, exit 0
#     api-500-fallback     — API 5xx, fallback, exit 0
#     api-404-error        — API 404, no fallback, exit 1
#     controller-down      — apiClient returns nil, fallback, exit 0
#     escape-hatch         — GC_NO_API=1, fallback, exit 0
#
# Semantics (two layers):
#
#   1. MANIFEST (scripts/routed-test-rows.manifest) — a checked-in list of the
#      files that MUST carry all six rows. Every manifest file must exist and be
#      fully covered. This is a NON-EMPTY denominator: without it, renaming a
#      row marker would drop every file to "0 rows found" and the old
#      any-then-all rule would pass vacuously, silently disabling the guard.
#      With it, the same rename makes every manifest file report <6 and fail.
#
#   2. DISCOVERY — any cmd_*_test.go NOT in the manifest that carries at least
#      one row must carry all six (a partially-migrated file is a bug), and a
#      fully-covered file missing from the manifest must be added (keeps the
#      manifest current so layer 1 keeps policing it).
#
# Exits non-zero on any violation; passes silently when the manifest files are
# fully covered and no unlisted file is partial or fully-covered-but-unlisted.
