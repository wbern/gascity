// Rules ast:vocabulary-alias, ast:plan-leg-store-chain and
// ast:uncounted-call-spelling: the evasions a line-oriented census cannot see.
//
// All three read expressions rather than declarations. The alias and
// uncounted-call rules watch the grep rule's own vocabulary — DERIVED from the
// shared pattern file, never restated — so a call-shaped row added there
// extends both censuses on the day it lands. The leg-chain rule is the
// structural twin of `c:plan-leg-store-access` and restates that one shape in
// Go (see the pattern file's family (c) note).
//
// See residency_boundary_test.go for the contract these rules are part of.

// The two evasions that are invisible to a line-oriented census by
// construction:
//
// (a) FUNCTION-VALUE ALIASING. Every call-shaped grep row demands a literal `(`
//     after the name, so `f := routes.storeFor` followed by `f(c)` names
//     nothing the census knows: the derivation is fetched under one name and
//     performed under another. `(routes.storeFor)(c)` evades the same row for
//     the same reason — the character after the name is `)`.
//
// (d) LINE-SPLIT FIELD ACCESS. `c:plan-leg-store-access` is anchored to one
//     line, and gofmt preserves a chain broken across three, so `pl.` / `Leg.` /
//     `Store` walks past it.
//
// Both belong here rather than in the pattern file because grep is the wrong
// instrument for each: a value-position row would have to match a name NOT
// followed by `(`, which fires inside strings and, worse, cannot tell a
// reference from a declaration — and the tree has both (`rigBeadStores` is a
// parameter name, `BeadStores()` an interface method). The AST knows the
// difference and is layout-blind.

// residencyGuardedNames is the identifier vocabulary the alias rule watches,
// DERIVED from the shared pattern file rather than restated here.
//
// A second hand-kept list of names would be this guard's own bug class one
// level up — the pattern file's header says as much about the two grep halves —
// and it would fail in a specific way: a vocabulary row added to the file would
// be aliasable from the day it landed, because only the census that counts
// CALLS would have learned the name.

// grep census would count, and under a suffix test they would fall out of the
// alias vocabulary with no record — the pattern file's promise that a new row
// extends both censuses would quietly stop being true. Under a containment test
